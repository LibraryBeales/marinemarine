to have given out their intention to buy no ore until late in the spring they point to stocks of ore on lake erie docks valued at at a low estimate as a reason for this conclusion and say that ore producers must come down in their prices this is all true enough under present conditions but it does not seem as though cleveland ore dealers will bother the furnace men in the matter of ore sales for some time tod come the feeling traveling expenses than is usual in january mr carnegie s de termination to delay purchases was anticipated he purchased a too early last fall single deals involving or more were made with him as early as thanksgiving time and it is reason able to suppose that the outcome of the market on which those purchases were made would prompt him to delay operations this f winter inthe meantime the ore dealers recognize the import ance of awaiting the outcome of the present depression in the iron industry as it can hardly become worse there have been some rumors of a combination among them to restrict produc tion but this does not seem reasonable to anyone acquainted with the diversity of interests in the business if the output is to be cut down the condition of the market will regulate the restric tion the sales agents have held two or three meetings and have submitted statements regarding stocks etc that would tend to indicate the course to be pursued but it is not probable that anything further has been done in the list of quotations on mining stocks the viinnsota iron company s shares and others have been noticeably marked down there is little or no

railway new schlesinger road has been con ditionally sold to the chicago and northwestern although mr schlesinger denies the report in building the line mr schles inger had the backing and support of business men in that part of northern michigan which the road traverses who were anxious to have a competing line by which they could secure better rates the northwestern has long enjoyed a monopoly of the business and the report that it has secured control of the escanaba has caused considerable ill feeling the soo line made strong efforts last spring to induce mr schlesinger to let te it complete the line but without success the escanaba road is and iron mountain only a small part of it is operated and its main business comes from schlesinger s iron mines the ion is to extend the line to florence and crystal falls to conr it with the schlesinger mines at those places se duluth newspapers are engaged in booming the mesabi range situated near the vermillion a great deal of exploring is going on it is claimed that no prospecting shaft has been sunk between the quartzite and slate formations without encountering a good quality of ore and that the general impress ion that the formation is of a thin blanket form has been proven erroneous by late developments este the big electrical companies are endeavoring to introduce labor saving machinery into the lake superior mines and it is probable that some of the apparatus will be given a trial shortly as the companies offer to make tests at their ownexpense they claim to have machinery for underground haulage and the oper ations of hoists pumps and drills that will lessen the cost of pro duction the managers of the iron river mine are among the pro ducers of low grade ore who have decided to restrict production in view of the unsatisfactory outlook in the market the mine has about tons of unsold ore in stock as this is about one third of the total sales of last year the plan of restriction seems advisable the two minnesota steamships the list of vessels building on the lakes as published in the marine review recently excited considerable attention as it showed tons of floating property valued at was under construction those figures however were just tons and less than they should have been making the entire tonnage building on the lakes and the valuation this deficiency was caused by not including the two steamships building by the chicago ship building company the carrying tonnage and valuation of which amounts to tons and they are the first steel vessels built as far west as chicago and are the first built by this company although the company is composed of gentlemen who have been connected for some time with the buiness of building steel ships practically the two ships are duplicates of the four minnesota ships built by the globe iron works company but they will have some features added that will easily distinguish them from their sister ships they will be ready for business at the open

review es more big steamers than seaports and rivers combined when an advance summary of the report of w w bates commissioner of navigation was given out some time ago lake interests were surprised to find that the atlantic coast builders had built more tonnage than the lake builders during the year ending june although building on the lakes in the two previous years had exceeded that of the atlantic coast and western rivers combined the reason for this however is the building of a great many small sail crafts on the atlantic coast while the steam tonnage built on the lakes is greater by

financial condition of the great money centers will be quickly felt in all lines of business and in none more so than the iron steel industies the suit of the owners of the barge keweenaw against the

smart for some of the plaintiff s witnesses capt james reid s many friends sympathize with him in his losses and financial troubles of the season now closing his latest undertaking was the successful

miles of heavy solid ice in lake st clair on her arrival here the tug was taken in charge by the united states marshal on a libel procured by thomas murphy in the sum of the claim being for use of

fall and all will be free to do soin the spring during the ensueing summer the new canal be tween rice s point and grassey point along the north shore of st louis bay will be rendered passable for vessels of the largest size at present en gaged in lake traffic the practical effect resulting from the construction of this channel is not only to give access to the manufacturing establish ments at

the cost but in all probability it will be about for a tunnel to accommodate railway and street railway tracks and a roadway and sidewalks it would require about two years to construct it mr smith

the last boat had given satisfaction and he saw no reason for the change his lack of progressiveness riled the white whiskered marmion and he shook with ire as he said yes you want everything the same

they have turned out wheels during the past season the international marine conference who represented the merchant marine in scanning the reports and proceedings of the international marine conference we find that all in all there were sixty one delegates from twenty eight governments their positions in life were as follows twen ty six officers of the navy among whom eight were admirals twenty five diplomatists etc six captains from the merchant marine and four law yers the merchant marine of the whole world for which the rules were made comprising a fleet of vessels hadin all six representatives all others being outsiders for we can not include the twenty six officers of the navy whose avocation is entirely different from that of the met chant marine being the representatives of annihilation not of preserva tion of destruction not of construction they cannot be considered to be representatives of the merchant marine yes there were allin all six united states one from norway and one from the netherlands a big show indeed what the people belonging to the diplomatic corps and kindred occupations knew of preventing collisions at sea is hard to tell but it is a fact that twenty five of them were present constituting nearly half the number of delegates england germany france and the united states furnished the four lawyers but it does not appear from the records that the french lawyer ever took any active part in the proceedings thus the other three lawyers had things all to themselves and were the acknowledged leaders in the conference no question being settled with out their taking the most active part in it of the six sailors not much is reported for whenever they attempted to oper their mouth there was somebody with a silvery tongue who made them shut up such was the composition of that iilustrious body framing the international rules of the road for the merchant marine how the rules were dealt with article reads in obeying and constructing the rules due regard shall be had to all dangers of navi gation and collision and to any special circumstances which may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid immediate danger after a prolonged discussion dr sieveking germany made the final declaration the law says to the sailors we give you certain rules we have given you these certain rules but of course there may arise circumstances where these rules are not applicable as unforeseen dangers of navigation or other circumstances and in case of such circum stances you are to depart from the rule you must not stick to the rule your principal object is always to avoid immediate danger and of course that means to avoid immediate danger of collisions that is quite clear if we say to avoid immediate danger of collision it s superfluous here we have an official acknowledgement of the imperfection of the interna tional rules by one of the principal framers and expounders and it is needless to say that under the american rules no circumstances can arise where they are not applicable and that shows their perfection in view of which it would be folly to exchange the american rules for the international rules distribution of thf voting power every state small or large owning a single boat or thousands of vessels was entitled to one vote thus costa rica with three vessels and great britain with vessels were on the same footing and why not the lives of the men who framed the rules were not at stake it was only the life of poor jack tar having no voice in the matter if the voting power had been divided ac cording to the number of vessels as so many individuals in each state and one vote been accorded to every thousand vessels the following list would give the number of votes for each

tonnage of the lakes was greater than that of the atlantic and gulf coasts the report of the commissioner of navigation presents figures even more important a table of comparisons made up from that document and printed elsewhere in this journal shows that the number of vessels of to tons owtied on the lakes is far greater than the total of this class of vessels in all other parts of the country more steam tonnage was built on the lakes last year than the combined product of all other sbipyards in the country and cleveland leads all cities of the country asa shipbuilding center in the matter of steel shipbuilding last year philadelphia s launches reached tons as against tons from cleveland yards another year will in probability bring down this small margin of tons and the lakes will also lead in the important metal hull industry tu report of gen o m poe u s a on the traffic of the st mary s falls canal during is being copied in leading trade publications throughout the country and the comment in connection with it is generally favorable to the importance of lake commerce he manufacturers record of baltimore uses the report in detail to urge the necessity of pushing improve ments on the mississippi river and in doing so attempts to be little the lake traffic by saying that the freights of the sault trade consists mainly of a few staples as against a great variety of commodities that might be handled on the mississippi this is certainly of poor taste when the report in question shows the greatest canal traffic inthe world the mississippi will need many millions in government appropriations before its shipping can be said to exceed that of all seaports of this country a con dition true of the lakes at the present time starboard the helm not the wheel capt t a ellery writes the marine review from marys ville mich to inquire why the point abino n mills tom scott j eh mills and other steam crafts of the smaller class were not included in the list recently prepared by capt george p mckay showing the manner in which lake vessels steer the boats named steer with crossed chains or steamboat style and capt ellery entertains some fears that they were purposely ex cluded from the list as the showing was overwhelmingly in favor of straight chains or ship fashion the boats in question were not included in the list simply because it was the understanding when the work was begun that only boats of tons and over should be considered this was done in order to exclude harbor tugs and other small craft that are not engaged in the general commerce of the lakes capt ellery has a word to say about the principle involved that is however worthy of attention he says i was in charge of sailing vessels twenty seven years and steamers about ten years and i hope that we will not be compelled to steer a steamer ship fashion when i tell a man to starboard his wheel it is simple enough for him to roll it to starboard it does not look right to me to tell a man to starboard and have him roll the wheel to port i be lieve in working a wheel as you do a tiller and then everything will work the one way capt ellery s argument is not new it has appeared many times in the discussion over this matter and the advocates of straight chains meet it by saying that the term or order star board means in all cases starboard your helm and not starboard your wheel to most vessel masters who have seen service in both sail and steam vessels reference to wheel helm or rudder in connec tion with the orders starboard or port is considered out of place if i see a vessel approaching

caisson or box used was water tight on the bottom and three sides while one side was provided with leaf doors consisting of planks arranged one above another and pivoted at the end attached to the box

lakes in regard to the difference of opinion in steering highty per cent of the steam tonnage on the lakes is managed by men whose vessels steer ship fashion and they are of the opinion that the twenty per cent of steam vessels that steer the reverse of ship fashion should change so that all vessels steer alike as the change would involve no expense and entail only a little more care on the part of the helmsman until he became familiar with a reversal of the order of steering there is no question but that the change should be made in fact a uniform method of steering that is port and starboard in connection with the wheel should prevail on all vessels that navigate the rivers lakes bays and sounds of the united states and the oceans the public highways for navigation all over the world let the opposition to a uniform mode of steering who are a small minority consider the question of steering ship fashion from an unselfish standpoint and they will all agree that starboard and

two similar ships to mark the two outer shoals on eleven foot shoal green bay the appropriations for permanent light houses which it is pro posed to use in the construction and equipment of these light ships on account of the funds being insufficient for the perma nent structures are each for simmons reef and eleven foot shoal and not for the latter as stated a week ago the lighthouse board has indorsed the plan of applying the appropriated for simmons reef to the construction of light ships but whether that body can be induced to take like action regarding the eleven foot shoal appropriation and the general plan of providing lightships instead of costly permanent struc tures at other points on the lakes isa question at the last meeting of the excelsior marine benevolent association the cleveland organization ot lake vessel masters capt george p mckay and capt james stone presented a series of resolutions indorsing congressman burton s bill for the simmons reef light

marked by lightships and waugoschance in full sight or sound the western approach to the straits will be well marked these two measures will not call for the appropriation of any additional sum of money at this time and it is the general opinion here that representative burton should include a provision for lightships to come from the eleven foot shoal appropriation in his bill providing for the change to lightships at simmons reef in this matter as well as other government works on lake michigan the vessel owners and masters have found reason to place a great deal of confidence in the recommendations of col ludlow of the corps of engineers u s a one light station or light ship regarding an appropriation for the construction of which there should be no furtner delay is that of bar point in che detroit river about midway between _ the detroit river light station and bois blanc island the ne cessity of this light in a channel where the tonnage each year for three years past has averaged about tons has been proven by the vessel owners of the lakes who have paid for the maintenance of a light there for two years past after staking out achannel the light house board has denounced private lights and should favor a government light where some light must be had it has been claimed that this light isin canadian water or on the border line but this should not be a bar to the estab lishment of a light in such an important locality let the offi cers of the board fix the locality of the light and if a slight change must be made in position it can in all probability be

all probability the day of steel is almost over aluminum will soon take its place a metal as little liable to tarnish in air or water as little or less affected by acids than gold twice as strong as steel and one third the weight as malleable and as ductile as gold aluminum offers advantages to the shipbuilder to the machinist and to all engaged in the mechanic arts in which any metal is employed that cannot be ignored and the only thing that stands in the way of its substitution for steel and iron and perhaps for copper tin lead and every other metal except zinc which has uses peculiar to

famous north star sheffield collision case has just appeared in full in the federal court reporter in the syllabus prepared by the court the point made is that when two steamers are approaching each other in a fog and repeated signals from each of them indicate that they are drawing together upon opposite or crossing courses it is the duty of each to stop until they come toa clear understanding with regard to their respective positions and course and if there be any confusion of signals or any other apparent risk of collision it is their duty not only to stop butto reverse theirengines in stat ing the case the court says the suit is for collision between the steamships sheffield and north star which occurred about o clock in the afternoon of june during a dense fog to the northward and westward of whitefish point lake superior resulting in the sinking and total loss of the sheffield the libel of the sheffield averred that while upon a trip from chicago to t wo harbors and after passing whitefish point and being put upon a w n w course she encountered a fog which gradually became denser and steadier while upon this course with a smooth sea and light wind and with her fog signals regularly blowing she heard the distant sounds of a steamer s whistle nearly ahead her engines were at once checked when the signal was heard again a little upon her starboard bow she was again checked and a signal of two blasts blown to which no answer was received the signal was repeated and the sheffield starboarded half a point the approaching steamer which proved to be the north star replied with one blast still a long distance away to make certain whether this was blown asa fog signal or a passing signal the sheffield blew a signal of two blasts two or three times to each of which the star answered with a signal of one blast thereupon the sheffield acquies cing in the demand of the star to pass port to port blew one blast and ported the vessels were then from one and one half totwo miles apart the star bearing less than a point upon the sheffield s starboard bow the sheffield was steadied under her port wheel n w by n this threw the star upon the port bow of the sheffield the steamers approached exchanging signals of one blast until the star was apparently well off upon the port side of the sheffield and all risk of collision seemed to be passed while in this situation a signal of two blasts was heard from the star apparently four points oft the sheffield s bow the vessels being now too close to change sides by star boarding the sheffield answered with one blast and ported nard again the star blew two blasts which were answered again by one and the star appeared through the fog heading for the sheffield two lengths or more distant on the port side and coming at great speed the master of the sheffield at once signaled to the engine for full speed and ordered the wheel amidships but two late to be of service the north star struck the sheffield at about right angles and near her port mizzen rigging cutting into her six or eight feet and sinking her within five minutes the answer averred that the north star being on a voyage from west superior to buftalo upon a course s e by e half e and running under check heard a signal of two blasts of a steam whistle about three quarters of a point over her starboard bow knowing this to be a passing signal of a steamer bound up the lake it was promptly answered by two blasts from the north star in less than a minute afterwards a second signal of two blasts was heard still upon the starboard bow which was again auswered by a similar signal from the star this was again re peated after the last signal was given and answered the approaching steamer which proved to be the sheffield suddenly blew a signal of one blast still off the star s starboard bow as soon as this was blown danger of collision was apprehended and the star promptly answered this signal by adhering to her own signal of two blasts and her speed was still further checked down again the sheffield blew a signal of one blast still upon the starboard bow but closer the engine of the star was then immediately stopped and while this order was being obeyed the _ sheffield hove in sight near to and heading across the bow of the star from starboard to port the collision occurred prac tically as stated in the libel st the court said we are entirely agreed in our opinion of this case i was prepared to decide the case upon the pleadings but out of deference to counsel and the probability of appeal i deemed it my duty to listen to the testimony i may say that in a practice of nearly thirty years in collision _ suits i can hardly recall a case where the negligence seemed so gross an inexcusable and none where the consequences were so disas trous indeed judging from the frequent collisions which taxe place in thick weather the hardest lesson which the masters of steam vessels can learn seems to be the proper method of pass ing each other in a fog as was remarked by mr justice butt in one of the last collision cases reported masters can always carry out the maneuvers in that way that is by stopping and i will not yield to what i know is the strong disinclination of the masters of these large vessels to stop their engines they hate and abhor the very idea but itis to my mind their duty to do so if they can not otherwise reduce their speed sufficiently there is no relaxation of the rule demanding extraordinary care in cases of vessels approaching each other ina fog think it is the duty of a vessel hearing the signal of a steamship ahead in a fog and by ahead i do not mean dead ahead necessarily but within one or two points upon either bow to reduce her speed and if she hears a second or third whistle nearer in the same di rection it is her duty to stop and wait until signals have passed between the two vessels which shall determine upon which side each shall go and that both vessels should proceed at the most moderate speed keeping themselves well in command until they bring themselves off each others bow to such a distance as to make it absolutely certain that by continuing under such check they will pass each other in safety i do not think they have any right to resume their full speed until they are directly or nearly abeam i have tried too many collision cases to attempt to reconcile the testimony of the crews of different vessels where it is so conflicting as it is in this case we shall take the salient and uncontradicted facts as they are sworn to by each side the sheffield was proceeding up the lake bound from white fish point to keweenaw point on a course w n w she was blow ing her usual fog signals her whistle being operated by an auto matic device which blew a fog signal once in fifty eight seconds while upon this course checked to half speed she heard very faintly at a great apparent distance and a little upon her star board bow a single blast from the star in answer to which she blew two blasts and checked she received no answer her aa yar ee eee e oy ae ae aero ee saigon rere seen at that to mania men i pica sy marine review me master then came on deck and hearing whistles on her star board bow he blew two blasts and starboarded half a point the other vessel answered by a single blast now whether that was intended as a fog signal or as a passsing signal is uncertain but at any rate it was a circumstance which called for immediate caution he blew two blasts again and that was answered by one and the signal was then repeated with the same response there was evidently a confusion of signals and as those vessels were getting nearer he should have stopped until he located the signals and the course of the approaching vessel instead of that he assumed that the north star was blowing passing signals though he had no assurance that they were not fog signals _in stead of stopping however he ported in the first place he ported upon the assumption that the star was blowing a passing signal instead of a fog signal which may have been untrue it is quite evident that if it had been a passing signal the sound would have crossed from his starboard to his port bow or at least it would have closed in but there is no testimony to indi cate that he swears that the whistles continued upon his starboard bow until after he ported the very fact that the sig nal did not close in or pass from his starboard to his port bow should have indicated to him that the star had not changed her course but was blowing a fog signal and that his porting would ultimately throw him directly across the bow ofthe star that was his second fault the third fault was in not stopping he should have stopped because he was laying out a new departure he was acquiescing in the signals of the north star if her sin gle blasts were intended as port signals and was throwing him self across her bow in case she should keep her course as the indications were she was doing now he says that he exchanged six or eight signals of one blast with the north star i doubt this but assume it to be true he exchanged six or eight signals of one blast and then very much to his surprise as he says after he had gotten the north star away over on his port bow the star blew two blasts which he answered by one and ported hard he did not stop then and the signal was repeated he should not only have stopped but he should have stopped and reversed and backed strong but after the second signal of two whistles to which he answered with one the vessels came in sight of each other anything that offered a possible escape was in order then eae the north star s course is certainly open to much less criti cism than that of the sheffield let us assume from the testi mony that she was running under a check of five miles an hour she claims she did not hear the fog signal from the sheffield but we do not believe that we think she must have heard the sig nal blast of the sheffield because the mate says that he heatd it and because the protest indicates that he heard it we have no indication that the star moderated her speed up to that time in fact it was about that time that the master sent the mate to the engineer to tell him to hurry up a little to put ona little more steam while signals of two blasts were being blown at a distance not exceeding a mile we are inclined to think that the first signal came from the star and this because the sheffield was under a port wheel at that time indeed it seems to us in credible that a steamer should be blowing a signal of two blasts while under a port wheel as to what took place at that time we refer to the allegations of the north star s answer although it is qualified to some extent by the oral testimony now it is manifest that at the time this signal of two blasts was heard on the north star the signals of the two steamers were conflicting and the circumstances all indicate that they could not have been more than a mile apart it was the instant duty of the north star to stop and back it is claimed that she did this but it is also uncontradicted that she checked her duty was to stop and her counsel have recognized this by saying that a cluster of sig nals to check to stop to back and to back strong were all given substantially at once and as one order in view of the allega tion of the answer we cannot believe that the protest does not indicate it my own view is that the first order given was to check that they waited until they got another blast from the sheffield and then they stopped tltat the sheffield immediately hove in sight when they reversed their engines but too late to be of any service the consequence was that she ran into the sheffield four or five feet it is said by a witness for the star who has made a mathematical calculation based upon the weight of the star and the strength of the sheffield s hull that her speed could not have exceeded a mile an hour our opinions however rather coincide with that of the intelligent witnesses produced by the sheffield capt kirby and mr angstrom who testified that in their opinion she must have been going at from five to seven miles an hour the experienced seamen who sit with mein this case give it as their opinion that she must have been going considering the depth of the cut and all the facts at a speed of about five miles an hour and i concur in that opinion a we are clearly of the opinion that the star was at fault for not taking prompter measures to stop and reverse her engine there must be a decree dividing the damages and referring the case to a commissioner to compute and report the same in a case taken up from the circuit court new york the supreme court recently decided that a longshoreman who while in the employ of a stevedore and engaged in loading a vessel is injured partly through the vessel s ignorance and partly through his own by falling from the bridge is not entirely prevented

office as second class mail matter published every thursday at perry payne bldg by the marine review pub co vol xxii cleveland aug foreign gues year no nearly three and a half millions value of orders for seventeen steel freight carriers already booked for next year by the consolidated ship yards of tite great lakes about is involved in orders for seventeen steel freighters al ready booked by the american ship building co for delivery next spring this does not include any of the vessels now nearing completion and in tended for service this year neither does it include the four vessels of canadian canal dimensions two steamers and two barges which are to be finished before the close of navigation this year and which are being built in the name of a b wolvin of duluth for a syndicate composed largely of stockholders of the american ship building co it is now more than probable that the consolidated ship yards of the lakes will have almost as many new vessels under construction during the coming winter as they had in the past winter the best proof of this opinion is the number of orders already placed and the fact also that negotiations now under way will add to the list a contract for another steamer and possibly three within the next few days vice president robert l ireland of the amer ican company who has been most active in the dealings with cleveland owners succeeded in increasing the j c gilchrist order from five to six steamers the sixth vessel will be the same as the others of about gross tons capacity and costing about alike to the other steamers she will also have triple expansion engines and scotch boilers the latter fitted with the howden system of hot draft the most important order of the past week comes from d r hanna of m a hanna co who is organizing a vessel company on the strength of an arrangement with the calumet hecla mining co for the transportation of its copper and for the movement of coal to the portage district the order from mr hanna is for four steel vessels two steamers and two barges each of about gross tons capacity the steamers will be of ft keel ft beam and ft depth they will have triple expansion engines and steam will be supplied by scotch boilers the schooners will be of about ft length and their general dimensions will be about the same as the schooner tyrone which was built some time ago at the old globe yard cleveland stockholders in the new company with mr hanna will be largely cleveland people on trips down the lakes the steamers will usually carry copper from the portage district while the barges will take ore from marquette there is of course quite a large movement of coal to the copper country that is available for vessels of this kind the ves sels will be named for officials of the calumet hecla mining co and the republic iron steel co the steamers will be t l livermore and r a warner and the schooners george a flagg and a w thompson the livermore will tow the flagg representing the calumet hecla co and the warner and thompson named for officials of the republic company will make up the second tow the announcement from chicago that a contract has just been secured for four steel steamers of canadian canal dimensions to ply in the atlantic coasting trade bears out president brown s predictions of several months ago that the lake yards were quite certain of securing considerable busi ness of this kind there is no information as yet regarding the owners of these vessels except that eastern grain dealers are to be interested in them it is said that chas counselman of chicago is a prime mover in the new organization and that the name will probably be northwestern transportation co the steamers will be built during the winter at south chicago and will be ready for delivery to their owners on salt water with the opening of navigation next spring the boats will be duplicates and will be designed for the carrying of package freight they will be given three gangways on each side and will have steel main decks their machinery equipment will consist of triple expansion engines with scotch boilers and in all details the plans will comprise everything up to date the cost of each boat will be or a total of for the entire order machinery will be placed in the stern with pilot house well for ward as is the general practice with lake vessels the builders are con fident that they can follow this plan for ocean service without impairing the value of the ships from a structural standpoint and have no fear of their ability to secure insurance on such vessels the gangways will also be something of an innovation for the coasting trade as ocean steamers have their cargoes hoisted through hatches in the deck as a general prac tice president brown has given the conditions of navigation on the atlantic a great deal of careful study and the combination of advan tageous ideas in the design in both types of ships is believed by vesselmen to have produced the very best kind of a cargo ship for coastwise naviga tion with the four wolvin vessels to be finished this fall the amer ican ship building co now has under way eight freighters that are intended for atlantic coast trade with the yards of the american ship building co filling up for the winter it is expected of course that the lake builders operating inde pendent of the consolidation will also be provided with about all the work they can care for the jenks ship building co of port huron has already decided to put down a steel steamer of canadian canal dimensions on yard account if a contract for other work is not secured at the works of the craig ship building ico toledo a steel steamer for atlantic coast service is being finished up for j l crosthwaite of buffalo who repre sents large southern lumber interests and at this yard also a steamer of welland canal dimensions is to be built for the hawgoods of cleveland but there is still room for another ship or two that might be completed about the opening of navigation next spring a second crosthwaite steamer also intended for salt water service is nearing completion at the works of the union dry dock co buffalo she will probably be turned over to her owners about oct the large package freight steamer building at the buffalo yard and which was contracted for last winter will probably not be finished in time for service this fall but in any event the union works will have place for a new vessel or two to be delivered next spring it is quite within probability that the light house board will ask the lake ship builders informally for proposals to build the sumac the light house tender designed for service in the ninth light house district which practically includes the whole of lake michigan when bids were

french steamer la bourgogne offered a prize of francs for the most effectual appa ratus for saving life on the high seas and the task of awarding the prize was by the maritime section of the paris universal exhibition intrusted to an international jury this jury appointed a commission of experts to report on the different kinds of apparatus submitted by competitors con sisting of the following

consrrouoction of many modern vessels of war by george crouse cook a series of articles on german ship building could not be complete without a description of government naval construction as carried on at the kaiserliche werft or navy yards of these works there are three the largest is at wilhelmshaven on the north sea the smallest at danzig on the baltic while the third to be described herewith is a happy in between representative of both and is in gaarden a small town on the kiel bay opposite the city of kiel foreigners are not allowed to visit the yard except by permission from naval headquarters granted upon application from representatives of the different countries at berlin even then it is impossible to acquire complete information regarding the works as much secrecy is maintained in certain parts of the works the men employed are sworn to secrecy and punishment meted out for violation of rules on this score affairs of the yard are directed by the navy department at berlin the executive on the ground being a regular naval officer of the rank of sea great pains and extreme care but the great loss of time involved in their methods is such as to render them unfit for competitive commercial work the yard itself lies north and south on the eastern shore of the kiel bay and it is laid out with that accurate precision and care which is a universal characteristic of government works grass plots and flower beds are to be found everywhere neat shaded walks run about the yard and all the shops are as bright and clean as care can make them even the tools although of the conventional german and scotch types seem to partake of the same spirit and run with a quietness and dignity un known in commercial surroundings on the shore of the bay to the left of the main gate which is on the southern limit of the yard are the three permanent building and launching ways from the first of these the armored cruiser prince henry was recently launched and on the third a similar vessel now known as cruiser b is under construction these ways which are made up solidly of stone and brick are carried down to some distance below the water level of the bay and at this point sides are built up as at the entrance of a dry dock when a ship is being laid down a caisson is put in place and the water pumped out giving free dry ground at a desirable point and at launching the caisson is removed the water rises to some height about the stern and the vessel has but a short run before clearing the ways the work here is carried ships built and building at kaiserliche werft kiel germany launoh of steel armored oruiser prince henry captain this captain has his own independent staff of men who execute the orders from berlin oversee the yard and are accountable for the condition and appearance of the grounds houses and shops the actual construction however is in the hands of the construction corps which consists of an especially trained body of men quite apart from the line officers and working under a flag other than that of the german navy the construction corps is divided into engineers and ship builders both being recruited from the royal technical high school at berlin where all regular students that is native born germans who are gymnasium graduates may become candidates at the state examination for a commission to the lowest rank of a ship or engine constructor these men are given the finest scientific education that is to be had in germany the course of training at the high school is very thorough it extends over a period of five years and in addition to the theoretical studies the candidates for these honors are required to serve one year as volunteer handworkers in ship yard or machine shop and at a certain period after their commission they are ordered to a modern warship for a five months cruise they are promoted in rank only when showing ability and qualifying in a bona fide examination assistants to these constructors are native germans of a more or less educated class of draftsmen and they are usually able practical men who have risen from the lower grades but they must remain for all time in positions sub ordinate to the commissioned constructors for this reason the govern ment service although offering fair pay and short hours is not con sidered desirable by any ambitious young men who may not have had the specific training of the high school the yard workmen must be as the men above them germans they are well trained and work with fuerst bismark a steel armored oruiser coast defense battleship aegir on with the same painstaking care as is shown in the ways themselves an elaborate lumber scaffolding is built about the ship with the first platform almost the height of the armor shelf and a second level about ft above this upon which is a track with a traveling steam crane the process of erection of the hull is one of extreme care no pains or expense being spared in any detail to produce a perfectly accurate strong body the ship machine shops stand just in from these ways nearly all the tools are of german manufacture but the largest pieces bear the mark of some scotch or british tool works back from the machine shops is a splendid mold loft with a narrow plank floor perfectly fitted and painted a light gray it is lighted from all sides and overhead elaborately colored drawings are laid down here of the stern stem and rudder frame and the whole ship s lines laid out in pencil and faired up with water lines buttocks and diagonals just north of the ways on the bay shore is the torpedo boat harbor protected from the sometimes rough water of the bay by a long sea wall running parallel with the shore with a section at right angles con necting the northern end with the shore here torpedo boats out of commission are laid up and here they come for coaling and repairs a simple efficient marine railway for torpedo boats is arranged at this point vive sets of track at right angles to the shore run with gentle incline into the water upon each track is a car with blocks of suitable form for supporting a boat these cars are let down into the water and the boat to be docked is floated over tliem set and then drawn by chains from one revolving shaft the cars bring up the boat without disturbing the officers or men who may be working and living on board during the period of repairing or cleaning by placing additional cars on the tracks marine review two or more boats may be drawn up at the same time along the shore are special sheds for torpedo boat repair work and also the shops for manufacturing torpedo bodies these however are forbidden sections of the works and even a special permit will permit of but a disconnected view of them above the torpedo boat harbor at right angles to the bay is a deep artificial basin both shores of which are lined with storehouses ships about to be commissioned or setting out for a cruise come to this point for supplies provisions ammunition etc this basin forms the northern boundary of the yard south of the supply basin is a narrow channel leading to a second basin into which the four dry docks open this is called the building basin here extensive repair work is performed and ships completed after launching about the sides of this basin stand enormous electrically powered shear legs for handling engines boilers armor plate etc here also temporary portable sheet metal sheds are set up at convenient points and fitted with the lighter tools the four docks are of stone each fitted with an independent set of pumps but so ar ranged that they may be concentrated on any single dock and thus the largest may be emptied in five hours recently in one of the docks a ton coast defense battleship the heimdall was cut amidships one end drawn out some ft and that additional length of ship built in the work was similar to that done on the united states gunboats castine and machias at the brooklyn navy yard some years ago and with equally satisfactory results an incident that caused some amuse ment among the thorough and precise germans occurred here a short time ago when a turkish cruiser which is to be reconstructed at the germania ship yard was docked through courtesy of german govern ment it was found that one blade of her four bladed propeller had been coast defense battleship hagen built at kaiserliche werft kiel germany broken off from the sea growth over the broken section it was quite plain that the blade was lost at least a year previous although it was wholly unknown the turkish officers who had been cruising about in the ship were entirely ignorant of what had occurred the engine and boiler shops together with a foundry are located close to this building basin and all are well fitted throughout the engine shop in particular is most elaborately arranged and is supplied with the highest type of modern german machinery many of the larger tools and the overhead traveling crane are worked by independent electric motors and all lathes drills and planers are so arranged that any section or particular machine may be thrown off without effecting general utility engines for all the vessels recently constructed here were made in these shops and they are excellent examples of the finest german naval engineering between these shops and the main gate stand the office buildings those of the executive staff and construction corps they are of a kind suited to the dignity of the tenants they are fitted with more comforts and labor saving devices than can ever be used and this may be said also of nearly every department of the yard it is to be regretted that so complete a plant cannot be worked on a business basis it may be worth noting also that near the yard gate is an excellent workingmen s club organized by a society corresponding to our y m c a where the men are entertained and given general popular instruction for a nominal charge four vessels built and building at these works are pictured in the illustrations leading particulars of these are as follows prince henry building steel armored cruiser displacement tons length ft breadth ft draught ft

american line steamship st paul last week this officer s visit to this country was for the purpose of in specting the war vessels under construction for russia at the cramp yards philadelphia t have been here on government business he explained and that business has been in connection with the cruiser variag and the ironclad retvzan which are building at the cramp works the variag has already had her trial and the retvzan will be completed in about nine months why did russia decide to build ships here we had an extensive naval program to carry out and in order to complete it it was necessary to build a number of ships at once for this reason orders were placed in germany france and the united states our yards were full the work which has been done here for russia will compare most favorably with that done in any country the new cruiser variag is a remarkable ship unfortunately i was not here in time to go on her trial trip on that trip she made faster time than was called for in the contract i believe the record of her trial was knots while the contract only called for knots these vessels when they are turned out by your yards will be complete and very little will be done to them when they reach russia the guns will be mounted here and the finishing touches put on so that they will practically be ready for service he added speaking of the work of the russian yards the general added that they could turn out a battle ship of the majestic english class in two or three years of course i know that in england vessels have been turned out in quicker time he added but you know that we work slowly and with great care twenty five years ago when i was a very young man i paid a visit to the united states and so this second visit has been unusually interesting to me on every hand i see the wonderful improvements made here the same improve ment which is to be seen in ship building is seen in everything and every where while here i saw your ship alabama she is a fine type of a sea fighter trial of the alabama over the cape ann course the trial trip of the battleship alabama will take place probably on aug the ship left the cramp yard philadelphia last week for the brooklyn navy yard while on the blocks of the brooklyn dock the alabama is to be thoroughly scraped and painted a specially prepared paint designed for use on ships bottoms to prevent them from fouling will be used below the water line novel in one respect the alabama will have her course marked out by the most formidable gathering of warships that ever welcomed any new ship into the navy orders have been received at the charleston navy yard to the effect that the battleships kearsarge kentucky indiana massachusetts and texas and the double turreted monitor amphitrite will rendezvous in president roads aug and that they are to act as station ships dur ing the trial of the latest addition to our navy the ships excepting the amphitrite are at present on the coast of maine the monitor is at new bedford the_tug iwana of the local yard will take the engineer corps down the harbor to the new ship the board which is to take charge of the trial and to report on it is made up of the following named naval officers rear admiral frederick rodgers capt robley d evans com joseph n hemphill com charles r roelker lieut com charles e vreeland lieut com richard henderson and naval con structor washington l capps the ship will run four hours under forced draft and must attain a speed of at least knots for each hour steamers for oriental service within a few days the contract of the oregon railway navigation co with dodwell co for the maintenance of a line of steamers be tween portland ore and the orient will expire the company has been negotiating for vessels to take the place of those now on the line but owing to the urgent demand for steamers for transport service have been delayed in securing vessels so that the new line will not be ready to take up the business before october hree steamers have already been secured but as they will not be available in time to prevent a break in the service dodwell co will operate the line for at least sixty days longer both the monmouthshire and braemar coming back again in the old line the new steamers which will replace the old line will be ton carriers newly built and equipped with the latest improvements for rapid and economical handling of freight while slightly larger carriers than the braemar and mogul and other vessels of that class they are so constructed that they will draw no more water than those vessels and accordingly no delay will be experienced in getting up and down the river a school has been established by the government at fort monroe va for the purpose of instructing regulars in the application of electrical machinery used in the army the rules published by direction of the secretary of war provide that the applicant must be under twenty five years of age unmarried qualified as a gunner a student of a corre spondence school or the owner of electrical books and no applicant will be recommended unless he has sought for a year or more to become prac tically familiar with ane or more classes of electric machinery or with some portion of the elementary literature on electricity marine hichborn s protest a warm letter to the seoretary of the navy on the subject of pro tected oruisers bitter controversy between heads of ship building bureaus a controversy which has become personal in its acrimony is now waging in washington on the subject of the protected cruisers authorized by the act of june chief constructor hichborn is entirely at va riance with the rest of the board on this subject he maintains that the circular recently issued by the board on the protected cruisers really de signs an armored cruiser and consequently violates the intent of congress the chief constructor stoutly maintains that congress knew what it was about when it specified that three armored cruisers should be constructed incidentally the chief constructor reveals the fact that he leans somewhat to the protected cruiser which he describes as a commerce destroyer he submits a design of a vessel to maintain a speed of knots after the russian and french type the variag and chauteaurenault this is a class of cruiser which has no counterpart in the british navy having slight defensive and offensive qualities and depending wholly upon superior speed to get out of danger the protected cruiser would make short work of an ocean liner or auxiliary cruiser but in turn an armored cruiser or battleship would make short work of a protected cruiser the type probably never will be popular for its chief defense is speed and speed is frequently a difficult thing to maintain no condition must be wanting to maintain knots and in active service conditions are some times wanting machinery will give way the minority report of the chief constructor or rather his protest against the circular dated aug and addressed to the secretary of the navy is as follows referring to the report of the majority of the board of construction submitting the circular proposed by it defining the chief characteristics of three protected cruisers authorized by act of congress approved june i have to state that i do not concur in the action of the board in submitting said circular and do not approve of the circular submitted under title increase of the navy enacted june provision is made for two sea going battleships carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to cost exclusive of armor and armament not exceeding three ar mored cruisers of about tons trial displacement carrying the heaviest armor and most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to cost exclusive of armor and armament not exceeding and three protected cruisers of about torts trial displace ment carrying the most powerful ordnance for vessels of their class and to cost exclusive of armament not exceeding tt will be observed from a reading of this act that congress provided for three types of vessels battleships armored cruisers and protected cruisers the act provides that the battleships and armored cruisers shall carry the heaviest armor for vessels of their class it omits any provision for armor for protected cruisers showing clearly that it was not the intention that said cruisers should carry armor said act limiting the cost of battleships and armored cruisers provides that the limit of cost shall be the amount stated exclusive of armor and armament with reference to the protected cruiser the act states that the cost shall be not exceeding exclusive of armament the circular submitted by the majority defines the chief character istics of the three armored cruisers and not of the protected cruisers as authorized by the act of congress approved june that congress in recommending the three protected cruisers in question thoroughly understood the distinction between armored cruisers and protected cruisers is clearly shown by a reference to page of the report no house of representatives fifty sixth congress first session being the re port from the committee on naval affairs submitting the naval appropria tion bill it is therein stated and credit is given to the office of naval intelligence for having furnished the information to the house naval com mittee that armored cruisers are vessels of moderate to large tonnage with protection to hull and battery similar to that of battleships except that the thickness of metal in all cases is much less which with the weight saved by carrying lighter guns gives opportunity to make the speed and steaming radius of the armored cruiser much greater than the battleship protected cruisers are vessels usually of small to moderate tonnage with protection to hull by protective deck coal bunkers and cellulose no side armor no turrets barbettes or casemates guns protected by gun shields had congress with this information before it desired the con struction of three more armored vessels they would undoubtedly have authorized the construction of armored cruisers instead of protected cruisers the circular of the majority of the board on construction describes an armored vessel which although larger than the new york and brook lyn is not superior to these vessels in many respects the armored ves sel produced on such lines would be nothing but a second class armored cruiser as compared with the six vessels of the california class which are first class armored cruisers the protected cruiser is designed for a special field of action she is intended to prey upon the commerce of the enemy and therefore on this type of vessel armor is sacrificed for high speed and ability to keep the sea for extended periods protection being afforded by protective decks arrangement of coal bunkers and cellulose in cofferdams protected cruisers have lately been built for the russian and french navies with speeds of knots the united states would be behind other nations by building protected cruisers of less speed which vessels would be unable to meet on even conditions the large passenger vessels of the merchant marine converted to naval use the provisions as to speed in the act of june are that the battleships shall have the highest practical speed and great radius of action the armored cruisers the highest practical speed and great radius of action the three protected cruisers the highest speed compatible with good cruising qualities and great radius of action it will therefore be observed that congress makes a distinction between the battleships and armored cruisers and the protected cruisers the protected cruisers being required to have the highest speed compatible with good cruising quali ties and great radius of action i am of the opinion that such conditions can only be met by sheathing the vessels which i believe to have been the intent of congress the question of the advisability of sheathing the review august battleships and armored cruisers provided for in the act of march was considered by the board on construction and the majority of that board recommended to the department that with reference to these two classes of ships congress be asked to modify the law the majority and minority reports on the subject were submitted by the honorable secre tary of the navy to congress for its consideration hearings on the sub ject were given admiral dewey and other officers by the naval committee after a thorough investigation of the subject no change was authorized in the requirement of the act of march as to sheathing and copper ing in view of the fact that the appropriation as made under the act of june is identical with the estimates furnished by this bureau for protected cruisers sheathed and coppered and taking into consideration also other facts connected with the passage of this act of which the de partment has been advised i am of the opinion that it was the intention of congress that the protected cruisers should be sheathed and coppered furthermore no question was raised by the majority of the board on con struction as to the advisability of sheathing and coppering protected cruisers i will not attempt to discuss this circular in detail as i consider it fundamentally unsatisfactory and at variance with the requirements as authorized by congress the limit of cost precludes the con struction of vessels as described by this circular as the cost of all hull armor even admitting that the use of armor is permitted by the act of congress must under a decision of the attorney general dated jan no navy department judge advocate general s office be de ducted from the limit of cost the majority estimates the cost of this armor at the weight of the side armor or main belt is stated at tons the lower casemate armor tons a portion of the upper casemate armor must be considered with this item but omitting this the tons of side armor and lower casemate armor at per ton a price less than has been paid for armor of this class would amount to and this sum must be deducted from the limit of cost a fur ther deduction of about should be made for designing and inspec tion and outfits to be supplied by the government with this deduction of the available limit of cost within which the contract would have to be let is but the contract price of the new york was and of the brooklyn notwithstanding the fact that the contracts on these vessels were made at a time when the prices of labor and materials were much lower than at present and the further fact that on these vessels large inducements were offered in the form of premiums for increased speed which were subsequently paid the actual cost of the new york tons lighter than the vessel proposed by the majority not including cost of armament armor for gun protection speed premiums and trial trip expenses as stated in the report of the honorable secretary of the navy for page was or more than the total available appropriation for the protected cruisers the corresponding cost of the brooklyn tons lighter on trial displacement than the ves sel proposed by the majority is given on page of the secretary s report as or more than the available ap propriation for each of the protected cruisers the limit of cost named in the acts authorizing the new york and brooklyn was in each case or more than the limit of cost for the vessels under consideration the chief constructor is prepared to furnish a circular and design a protected cruiser meeting in all respects the requirements of the law and carrying the battery except the l pounders in military tops desired by the majority of the board being a sheathed protected cruiser of about tons displacement and having a speed of knots one knot addi tional to that required by the majority having the same coal capacity on a less displacement and with consequently greater radius of action such a vessel can be designed and built within the limit of cost following is a comparative statement of the dimensions of the vessel proposed by the majority and
