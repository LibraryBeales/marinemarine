A good palce to start would be a sentiment graph 
over time to see if there is an interesting correleation 
between sentiment and global/regional/local events.     

Need to keep in mind my local historical knowledge is lacking.  
Locate local resources to share this with and interpret visualizations, starting with Walter Lewis.
