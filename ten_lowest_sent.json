the curtailment of argentina's wheat exports, all coupled with a continuation of. the high bunker charges con- tribute to darken the disturbed shipping outlook. during last month it was estimated that 100 shipping board vessels were tied up because of the fuel oil shortage. the shipping board, however, signed con- tracts with oil companies for a supply of approxi- mately 26,000,000 barrels, but some of this will cost $2.60 a barrel and, furthermore, the board must charter tankers to the companies supplying the oil. in the face of such conditions, american steamship owners have shown a fighting spirit with the result that an agreement was reached with deck officers, to run another year, without an advance in wages. the longshoremen's strike at philadelphia was practically broken and the transfer interests of new york are making some progress in establishing the open shop. more ships have been leaving the atlantic ports and it is reputed that cargoes have been increasing but this movement has been attributed only to a better flow of freight through the ports due to a betterment in labor conditions, and not to any increase in inter- national trade. the coal restrictions imposed by the government have limited an important trade and rates to france dropped to $13.50 a ton. time charter rates have dropped from $6.25 to $3.75. the shipping board now owns over 3400 ocean going

a 10,000-ton tanker from the new york shipbuilding corp. last month, paying $225 a deadweight ton, and the tidewater oil co. let a contract for a tanker of like size to the sun shipbuilding co. following the announcement of the intention of the munson line to let contracts for two new passenger boats, it was learned that the american line of the international mercantile marine co. proposes to build four new transatlantic liners. these new building contracts have, it is understood, been proposed on account of _ that provision of the new shipping act which exempts 484 there is a marked surplus: shipping companies from the profits tax when such tax is reinvested in new shipping' properties. the united states transport co. is thinking of engaging in the passenger business, although it jis not quite clear where it will obtain the necessary vessels. the polish government has issued a license to the red star line to transact a steamship business in that republic. the gorhlanp of that line will sail for danzig before the end of august. the polish-american navigation corp. is also contemplat- ing the operation of a passenger service from new york to danzig. it will attempt to obtain the ton- nage. from the shipping board. the black diamond steamship co., which started as a negro venture, is sending the steamers tutsa and colltincsworth from new york and baltimore to antwerp and rotterdam. the new york oceanic co., inc., plans a service from both philadelphia and baltimore. the caribbean steamship co., ltd., will resume its regular, direct freight service from new york to curacao and venezuelan ports. the five continent steamship co. has established a_ service between new orleans, cartagena and puerto colom- bia. the isthmian line has a cargo service from new orleans

threatened by the cunarder aguitaniaa. on aug. 6. she set a new mark for short distances when she covered 129 miles in 3 hours and 42 minutes at an average speed of 27.40 knots an hour, beating the mauvretania's record by more than a knot an hour. the mauretania still holds the record for an entire voyage, both east and westbound between queenstown and new york, over the northerly course of 2851 miles. starting sept. 11, 1910, from queenstown, she reached new york in 4 days, 10 hours and 41 minutes at an average speed of 26.06 knots. the aguitania has just been con- verted into an oil burner. previous- ly her best average was 24 knots. ping board for 4  j experts in this country and abroad this service. merchants of richmond, va., have organized the richmond-new york steamship co:;, lanning to use some of the lake type of vessels. while overseas activities continue to incite ship- ping people to incorporating new maritime ventures, the coastwise business has been extremely confusing. the mallory line was forced to suspend services at galveston owing to the longshoremen's strike, but resumed its sailings to that port the latter part of july. this same line, however, ceased its services to mobile because the freights offered and the rates that could be charged were not. adequate to cover the cost of doing business. the congestion at havana continues, at one time as many as 65 ships being delayed there. one of the ward liners was delayed in havana for 22 days. the passenger steamer governor cozs, has been sold by the eastern steamship co. to the peninsular & occidental steamship co., and will be operated between gulf ports and cuba. the guif export & trausportation co. has moved its offices from beau- mont to houston, tex. the new england maritime corp. has changed its name to the north atlantic & western steamship co., boston. the southern pa- cific co. was refused permission by the interstate commerce commission to establish a \"roving\" service in the coastwise trade. german steamship interests are ap- parently optimistic over the arrange- foreign ments made with the harriman shiv f; group and the u. 3.) mai line ip tirms for the re-establishment of the old active german steamship routes. they point to these agreements as the first step toward restoring foreign con- fidence and mutual trade relations. in accordance with the peace terms, germany thas surrendered approximately 400 ships to the allies. a movement 8 now on foot to re-establish the german shipbuild- ing industry, obtaining shipbuilding material in the united states. in view of this more favorable out- look for ger- man_ shipping, the hamburg- american and the north ger- man lloyd have exhibit war prizes qo' aug. 9 one of the. final chapters of america's part in the world war was written at new york when five surrendered german warships anchored in the hudson river, they were the dreadnaught \u00a9 osrrrieslannp, the cruiser frankfortt, and three de- stroyers, v-43, g-102 and s-132. the last four surrendered at the time of the armistice and were sunk later by their crews at scapa flow. the osrrrirslanp was bad- | ly damaged in the battle of jut- land, the ships will be exhibited | im this country and must be de- stroyed within 12 months. all ex- sept the dreadnaught are in bad condition, being towed across the atlantic, the battleship carried steam. : sen renewed their agreement not to engage in competitive un- dertakitigs, an agreement such as they had prior to the war. it is also said that the north german lloyd, the hansa, the argo and the neptune com- panies plan to form a big ship- ping trust to exclude foreign capital' this 485 rates decline pacific quotations are easier as less freight seeks vessel space--boston trade holds up trust is in line with germany's new industrial policy. furthermore reports state that the woermann line, the deutsche ost afrika line, the hamburg-amer- ican line, the amerika line, and the hamburg-bremen line, intend to resume their services to west and southwest africa. these german plans are in marked contrast to the conditions in england. the english steamship own- ers are so concerned over the falling rates that they -- are beginning to cancel shipbuilding contracts which have already been let. the one development of im- portance during the month was the merger of the canadian steamship lines, ltd., with the $500,000,000 british steel corp. the royal mail steam packet co. will soon receive some new passenger steamers for its south american service, and will have con- structed some steamers for the frozen meat trade. the canadian pacific ocean services proposes to establish a service from montreal to danzig. france, it is now expected, will obtain the german steamers seized by -brazil during the war. the french compagnie generale transatlantique has ar- ranged to start a monthly line from hamburg to the western coast of south america, via the panama canal, and also a line from haniburg to cuba and mexico. this line has also advertised a service from baltimore to french ports for general cargo. the holland-america line will establish the rotterdam- south america service which will call at buenos aires and other south american ports. in associa- tion with the royal packet co., the holland-america line will .establish a freight service between the netherlands and san francisco and other pacific ports, via the panama canal. : the peak of the passenger traffic to europe has been reached. for the passenger next six weeks, the first and second class bookings show a decrease, but trafhe are expected to pick up again in the falls off autumn. the transatlantic confer- ence has decided to increase the third- class rates owing to the unprecedented demand. . hereafter, the minimum third-class rates from new york to harve will be $85, to hamburg. $120, and to danzig $135. ~the west indies market has -been active and shows signs of continuing. the big demand has been for space for miscellaneous merchandise from foodstuffs to structural steel. the shipping board is planning to use some of the lake-built vessels to bring grain from the great lakes region to seaboard thereby removing the strain on rail transportation from the lower lake ports to seaboard. _ since the british companies have restricted their insurance activities, the movement to broaden the  * 486 american business has received an impetus. it was stated that more than 50 fire and marine insurance companies have signed the marine syndicate agree- ment which was fostered by the shipping board. syndicate a will make surveys. syndicate b, the most important, has already begun to write policies. syndicate c is yet to be organized. two angles mark the charter situa- tion in the north pacific. one refers pacific to the transpacific trade between ports trad on this side and japan, china and ee the philippines. the second has ref- unsettled erence to the movement of freight in other directions. with respect to the transpacific routes, business is in a chaotic condition. freights are low, bookings are light and the movement of cargo in both directions has dropped materially. great uncertainty prevails especially because of the fear that section 28 of the jones act will drive foreign tonnage from north pacific united states ports. on other routes, chartering is limited, with freights gradually declining. not much business is being done as foreign buyers are expecting further recessions in rates and in consequence they are holding back. 'this is particularly true with respect to lumber. how- ever, there is no idle tonnage in pacific waters at present and operators appear to have little difficulty in finding employment for their carriers. since a month ago, when the transpacific conference reduced the rate on lumber to the orient from $35 to $25, business has declined. in other words, the reduced rate has failed to stimulate the movement of lumber as there is little demand for it in the far east. japan is fully stocked for the present and financial conditions in that country are not conducive to buying in this country. the same conference reduced the rate on cotton 50 cents per hundredweight and the tariff on autos and other overland freight was cut, to place pacific terminals on an equality with atlantic and gulf gateways. the rate on salt fish was also cut. flour remains at $10 per ton and steel is now being handled at $11 per ton. in other words, operators state that present tariffs are on a prewar basis, plus the increased cost of operation. the members of the conference are said to be adhering to the new tariff on the assump- tion that further cuts will not bring new business. vessels from the orient are return- ing either in ballast or with very freight light cargoes. more than. sufficient oo tonnage is available to care for the westbound movement and altogether drop the indications are that there will be several months of light business for steamers operating to the far east. reports from japan state that vessels are already being taken out of commission because of lack of business and low charter rates. many owners who had their carriers hired out at fancy freights during the last three years are having their vessels returned and they are now seeking tramp trades in which to ae chartering in japan is said to be extremely ull. lumber freights to south america have dropped from $35 to $30, to cuba from $25 to $18 and to australia from a $35 basis to $33 and $30. several recent charters have been done at private terms or on a lump sum basis which are usual indications of a falling market. two large steamers have been the marine review september, 1920 fixed to carry railroad ties from puget sound anq columbia river at $45 per 1000 feet while grain ton. nage has been taken on a basis of $25 and $26 to united kingdom or continent. several sailing ships have been chartered for barley from san francisco or north at 150 shillings which is considered a high level. a large steamer has been fixed for flour or wheat from portland to south africa at 157 shillings 6 pence. brokers are seeking tonnage to freight coal from puget sound to scandinavian ports at from $20 to $23, this being business much out of the ordinary. ' admiralty control of british ships ended on july 15 and this means that considerable additional ton- nage is likely to be thrown on the world's market. western shippers are anticipating further declines in freights and this state of mind is responsible, in large degree, for the lack of interest in the market at the present time. an easier freight situation las helped to increase the shipping from the boston's port of boston, but grain which ordi- narily at this time of the year forms trade an important part of the port's ex- holds up ports has been almost entirely: absent : from the past month's list. canadian grain has either been leaving from canadian ports or from portland, me., or new york. shippers claim the reason that boston has been skipped is entirely on account of the railway situa- tion. manufactured products of new england have figured largely in the month's exports and increased tonnages in this line are reported by many lines. c. h. sprague & co., operating lines to scandinavia' and the mediterranean, report better conditions in both of these fields than existed a month ago. ma- chinery and machine tools have been in better demand from holland and norway. this company has re- cently inaugurated a new service between boston and ~ the far east by way of the panama canal. space for england and france has been in better demand and vessels formerly forced to put into other ports to complete their cargoes have recently been sailing direct from boston. : exports have included steel rails, heavy steel scrap, flour, shoe machin- exports ery and paper mill machinery for . scotland; shoes, machinery of various show wide kinds, crane equipment, blowers and range tteather for. england; tacks, nails, g g niiscellaneous machinery, hooks, car- penter tools, asbestos and leather for italy; sheet steel, iron bars, miscellaneous machinery, nails, tacks, arms and ammunition, automobile parts, structural shapes, wire, and lumber for buenos aires. imports have fallen off in most cases but cargoes from england have been about normal with mis- cellaneous items including hide cuttings, paper stock, optical glass, earthenware, chalk, yarn and cotton. coastwise shipping thas increased in spite of the small amount of coal reaching boston from the south. the cape cod canal co. reports 951 vessels having passed through the canal during the past month. the united fruit co. has started a new service between boston and the canal zone. ship- ments already made have included machinery, leather, cotton goods, shoes and other manufactured products. the service from boston to galveston recently 1n- augurated by the clyde-mallory line is proving highly successful. cargo has even exceeded available space.  september, 1920 the marin e. review 487 ocean freight rates per 100 pounds unless otherwise stated new york coal from e ; grain provisions aren flour wo ioe he oa a perpool ....... $ 0.45 $ 0.75 $ 1.80 $ 0.65 $ 0.50 $1.00: $10.00t hon 6... 045 0.75 1.80 0.65 0.50 1.00 10.00 t rene pea ionia, 2... 1.00 1.50 2.15 1.07 0.85 150 1500t $1400t copenhagen ..... 0.90 125 2.00 1.05 0.70 1.504% - 12.00 14.00 t pee 3... 0.50 1.00 1.92% 0.85 0.65 125. 1000 t 14.25 t been ony see 0.55 1.00 1.92% 0.85 0.65 125 10.00 t 14.25 t feoterdam ...... - 0.50 o75 1.57% 0.70 0.55 1.00 12.00 t 13.501 preweep s.. ee 0.45 0.75 155 0.70 0.50 1.00 10.00 t 13.50 1 ee te 0.70 0.90 1.821% 0.90 0.60 125 8.00 t 1200 7 bordeaux ....... 0.70 0.90 1.821% 0.90 0.60 125 8.00 t 12.00 t pareelona ...~:.. 30:00 7. 30,00 \u00a3 2.50 30.00 t --30.00 t-- 18.00 t 15.257 nearer 30.00 et. 3000 \u00a3 2.50: 30,00 1 --30.00 t-- 18.00 t 1350-7 marseilles ....... 0.75 1.25 1.72% 125 0.70 1.50 15.08 t 15.25. oe cs. 0.70 110 1.47% 1.00 0.65 1.20 12.00 t- 15.257 peles. ccc es 0.70 110 1.4714 [0g = 065 1.20 12.00 t 15.255 constantinople .... 23.001 28007 eo 2000 7 --28.00 t--- 18.00 t 75 bieadtia ...... oes 1.40 ee 20.00 t 0.62% l112 15.00 tf 75) es ges 1.75 coe, 1.25 0.8714 156% 15.00t 15-25-17 ee 2300\u00b0f- 23007 oe. 23.00 \u00a9 --23.00 t-- zoo fea, caperownh ....... eae one fare 30.00. t --27\/.00 t-- o00 ta fa dees aires wi. wee. ee aes ne --20.00 t--}_ iz00 tp). 11.005 mao de janeiro... is oe ea --18.50 t--} 120 ti: 10.507 femambuco ..... eee beck oeeg bee --19.00 t--} 13.00 te) 1007 peeve ook... o55 0.63 ee: 0.55 ne ones o71 2 weaparaiso~.. 2... 125 425 1.16 125 0.63 1.16 18.00 t seas, bin francisco .2.- 22, 1.40 oe 0.75 eae ee o72. a, dyaney = io. ce: eee ead on 23,00: to 30.00t 18,007' t--ton. +landed : heavy products except rails. from north pacific lumber from north pacific'. _ lumber ports to per m. ft. 5 oe to oe m. ft.

'assuming that 28 fires. are cleaned every watch, approximately 8000 horsepower is lost every four hours. with oil-fired boilers, no such loss is incurred, as the oil can be supplied continuously to the burners, and the heating maintained so that a constant steam pressure is kept up. this will have the effect of improving the speed of the vessel. as the tem- perature of the boilers is maintained at a constant figure, the bill for boiler repairs will be considerably reduced. there will be no ashes to remove, and consequently no dust and inconvenience to passengers from that source. the absence of noise and dust when bunk- ering is also not to be overlooked in a vessel of this type and size. one of the advantages claimed for the tse of of \"fuel mm slips 15: the additional cargo space available, due of 27.40 knots an hour, surpassing the mauretania's ee. mita *. to the fuel being carriedin the ship's cellular double-bottom ~ tanks: \u00a9the aquitania, however, is \"fot -a- cargo carrier, and it was not a_ practical proposition to utilize the orig- inal coal bunkers for cargo purposes. as no great advantage was to be gained by using the double-bottom tanks for storing the oil, it was decided to re- construct the coal bunkers for oil carrying. where oil is carried in this ship, with a beam of 97 feet, with three large double-ended boilers arranged abreast, there remains a space of about 18 feet amidships, gradually reducing to 6 feet at the forward end of the boiler space, which formed the coal bunker on each side, and in this space, extending the full length of the boiler space, a matter of 369 feet, the oil is carried. these side tanks do not,form one continuous group on each side, but are broken into two groups, port and starboard, by frahm's anti- rolling tanks, which take up 32 feet of the length. in addition to these side. bunkers, large athwartship bunk- ers, arranged forward of no. 1 boiler room, between nos. 1 and 2, and _ be- tween nos. 2 and 3, have also been made suitable for oil carrying. the large storage capacity in these side -tauks and cross bunker tanks, how- ever, did not prove sufficient to enable the ship to perform the double trip without requiring replenishing, so six of the double-bottom tanks have been made suitable for oil, to enable the 7600 tons of oil required to be shipped at new york. of the total quantity,  [coat mene

will not occur with the weight of oil pressing against them. all the plate joints have been specially treated, the general practice adopted being to fit stout, double riveted, joggled plate straps over each plate landing, making a thoroughly oiltight joint. special at- on has been given to plating and mveting of all steam pipe trunks and passages where these penetrate the toss bunkers, transverse wash bulkheads have peen fitted in all the side bunkers, and stitable wash bulkheads have also been the marine. review the cross oil constructed in bunker tanks to that not im. any way affected by the movement of the ship. for the full length of the side bunk- ers, and also around the cross bunkers, gutterways have been constructed to catch any oil which may find its way outside the tanks through leaky joints. insure rs in communication with these gutter- ways are bilge wells in each boiler room from which the oil bilge well pumps draw. in the cross bunker storage tanks general arrangement of furnace fronts as forward of boiler rooms nos. 1, 2 and 3, four settling tanks have been con- structed, each tank being of. 60-ton capacity. in no. 4, boiler room, two settling tanks of similar capacity each have been incorporated in the side bunkers, one port and one starboard. in the aguirania, there are four boiler rooms, the three forward ones each containing six double-ended _ boil- ers, and the after one three double- ended boilers. two settling tanks are provided for each group of three boil- ers. in certain parts of the boiler room, the side bunkers overhang the wing boilers, and to insure that there will be no chance of oil dripping on 491 the hot boiler tops, special screen plates have been fitted in way of these overhanging parts, so that any oil which may leak through will be directed to the oil gutter below. in addition which has tight joints welding has to the special riveting adopted to insure oil- all the tanks, electric also. been. largely em- ployed,

for each group of. three boilers, that is, in the large boiler rooms each containing six boilers, there are four sets of pumping and heating plants, while in the small boiler rooms there are two sets. this insures that only under very exceptional circum- stances will the supply of fuel to the burners be interfered with through any fault of the pumping plant. the pump- ing and filling arrangement throughout the ship has been prepared on a sub-  492 stantial - scale with a view to insuring the satisfactory operation of the ship under all. circumstances. for the full length of the boiler rooms, two suction and filling mains, of 8-inch bore, are fitted, one port and one starboard. in each boiler room, these mains are cross connected, and in addition suitable shut-off valves are provided, so that the system in one boiler room can be entirely isolated from any other boiler _ room, how liner is bunkered special attention was also given to the bunkering arrangements, so as to insure that the minimum of time will be required to bunker the vessel. each boiler room is provided with two 8-inch filling pipes from the working deck, one port and one starboard. these pipes communicate with the suction mains. ('special filling compartments have been arranged on \"e\" deck, where the connections for couplings to the tank steamer or shore hose are fitted. these compartments are entirely sepa- tate from adjoining accommodations, so that should any oil escape from the save-all trays which are fitted under the valves and strainers, the oil will not be free to spread over the deck. on 'each. side of the ship;. there are four connections for bunkering pur- poses. -- precautions have been taken to elimi- nate all possibility of overfilling the tanks. a special arrangement of air and overflow pipes has been installed by means of 'which should any tank be inadvertently overfilled, the oil overflow into one of the storage tanks specially arranged for this purpose. an overflow storage tank is provided in each group of tanks in each boiler room, port: and starboard. with the arrangement of overflow pipes and tanks, a sequence of tank-filling must be ad- hered to. these overflow connections, however, are only fitted as a safeguard should the other means provided for ening. the quantity | of oil in the tanks fail. each storage tank is provided with a gage, supplied by messrs. kelvin, bot- tomley & baird, glasgow, scotland. by means of these gages, the depth of oil and quantity of oil in the tanks can be noted at any time. it is usual to fill the tanks to 95 per cent of their capacity, and this quantity is indicated on each gage. in addition to these gages, electric float alarms are fitted, so that when the 95 per cent capacity ievel 15 feached, a bell rings. no sounding pipes are fitted in any of 'the oil tanks. to insure that the oil will run freely from the tanks in cold weather, or when heavy oil is being used, heating coils are fitted in all the side bunker will \u00a9 the marine review tanks and in the double bottom tanks, but not in the cross bunker tanks, where it is considered the heating of the adjacent boiler rooms renders heat- ing coils unnecessary. from the storage tanks, the oil is pumped by large, vertical, direct acting pumps of weirs' design to the settling tanks. two of these transfer pumps are fitted in each boiler room, those in no. 4 boiler room being of 70 tons per hour capacity each, and those in the other boiler rooms of 100 tons per hour capacity each. the capacity of each settling tank is such as to insurd 1\u00a2 hours' supply for three double-ended boilers, so that about 15 hours will be allowed for the settling of the oil in one tank while the other tank is in use. to facilitate separation of water from the oil; heating coils are fitted in these tanks. gages and electric float alarms are also fitted to the settling tanks. the removal of the settled water from the tanks is done by the transfer pumps, for this purpose, so arranged that it will not be possible for the pumps to draw oil from the settling tanks and discharge it overboard. precautions against fire from the settling tanks, the oil pressure pumps take their supply through suction strainers, discharging through the heaters and discharge! filters to the burners in the furnaces. a ring main is fitted in each boiler room to which each pump unit is connected. an emergency connection is also 'made to this ring main so that the pressure pumps can draw direct from the oil storage tanks. special attention has been given to the fire extinguishing arrangement in the boiler room. with a view to speedy detection of oii on the dotble-bottom tank tops, a special skeleton arrange- ment of stokehold flooring has been fitted. broad working gangways have been fitted in front of the furnaces, but these gangways are kept well clear of the bulkheads, leaving an open space to view the tank top and oil gutters. no wood has been used in the con- struction of the flooring. the electric wiring of the boiler rooms has been rearranged to suit the altered conditions. the ventilation of each boiler room, auxiliary machinery: room, passage, fan flat, tank tops, etc., has been thoroughly considered. addi- tional ventilating fans and trunks have been fitted. for raising steam from cold boilers, a motor-driven pump is fitted in one boiler room. when re- quired, power can be obtained for this pump from the emergency lighting set on the ship, or from shore current supply. hand operating, steam raising pumps are titted in each of the other which have special connections | september, 1920 boiler rooms. special gas exhausting nozzles and pipes with connections to the oil suction mains have been fitted to remove dangerous gases from- the storage tanks before these are en- tered for inspection. critics of the steamship companies which have shown the courage to tury the greatest express transatlantic liners into oil burners declare that the oil supply of the world is not adequate to meet the present. and future demand and, therefore, it is unwise for the merchant marine to place its entire dependency upon this form of bunker. ~ these critics have been answered by william albert white, the inventor and engineer who supervised the work on the oxrympic, and whose patent devices were installed on the aourranta. it was largely upon the advice of such engineers as mr. white, that the cun- ard and the white- star lines con- sented to withdraw their prize ships from service for nearly a year go that they could be converted to oil burners. mr. white declares that the produc- tion of fuel oil is assured in adequate quantities. in a formal statement he issued through the white star mr. white - said: \"take the tampico district of mexico alone with a known petroliferous area of 12,506 square miles, of which not more than 2 per cent has been devel- oped, and yet this development has in- creased the production from 78,110,000 barrels of 42 gallons in 1911, to 278- 160,000 barrels in 1915, with only an eccasional dry well. while this is the amount of production, only a small portion, 13 per cent, or about 36,000,- 000 barrels is being exported, due en- tirely to the shortage of transportation facilities. as these facilities can and are being increased, just so fast will cil fuel be adopted. \"the fuel oil developments of the world are considerably in excess of the amount of oil exported, due entirely te. the lack of transportation: ~ this may be readily demonstrated by taking mexico alone, of the western hemi- sphere, disregarding california, texas, oklahoma, and last but by progress not least, peru and venezuela, of which large areas are petroliferous, and the figures are staggering. line, lack of tanker tonnage \"the present daily potential produc- tion of mexico, but not exported, is around 762,080 barrels, or 278,160,000 barrels a year, equaling 42,100,000 tons. and this out of a very small percentage of the petroliferous area of mexico alone. to handle this quantity. would require eleven 10,000-ton tank ships to sail daily from the ports of tampico - and tuxpam.. give each ship an aver-  september, 1920 age voyage of 30 days' round trip and we find it would require 335 ships of this size, or twice the world's present total' oil tonnage, to transport the hep oil of the--tampico district of mexico alone. when it is remem- pered that this district represents less than 1 per cent of the total production, we need have no fear of the fuel oil supply for the future gen- eration being assured and, in fact, the present potential production the tampico field alone is now 18 per cent world's of \u00a9 international piln service oil transfer of the total coal production of great britain. the entire situation is;

improved design large oil carrier given greater loading and unloading facilities t oe plans of the standard oil co. include the construc- tion of some of the most ad- vanced oil carriers of the sea. the program calls for the early delivery of some of the largest tankers built, in- cluding two tankers which will exceed in. size anything so far constructed in the world. the standard oil com panies as a whole have 23 tankers under construction, the building pro- gram of the standard oil co. of new jersey being especially extensive. for this company orders call for three tankers of 10,000 tons to be built by the moore shipbuilding co., oakland, cal.; two tankers of 10,400 tons to be built by the sun shipbuilding co., chester, pa.; three tankers .of 11,790 tons to be built by the g. m. standifer construction corp., vancouver, wash.; two tankers of 11,900 tons to be built by the oscar daniels shipbuilding co., brunswick, ga., and five tankers of 15100 tons. each to be built by. the federal shipbuilding co, kearny, nv j. the. five tankers building at the federal yards are twin-screw vessels capable of making 11.5 knots on trial. in this respect they depart from the 'accepted plans of tankers which have heretofore been practically uniformly single-screw. the building program of the standard oil co. of new jersey, however, did not rest with the large federal tankers but the company ordered two other twin-screw tankers which will exceed in size even the record-breaking british tankers. these two are being built by the newport news shipbuilding & drydock co., newport news, va., and when fully classified it is expected they will measure at least 20,000 tons dead- weight and probably more. these giant tankers will measure 555 feet between perpendiculars and have a 75-foot beam. they will have a molded depth of 43 feet and a loaded draft of 30 feet. it is planned to have them propelled by two triple expansion en- sines of 38,000 indicated horsepower. their capacity will be 135,000 barrels o gi. this building program will place the standard oil company in the front tanks of the great dispensors of oil of the world. it will bring under one house flag probably the largest indus- trial fleet in existence, for the company owned some #7 tankers before the new ships were designed. the fleet of 47 to cut tankers already in existence boats of from 6000 to 17,000 tons deadweight. the standard oil co. of new jersey before the new construc- tion plans were announced had a total of 52 seagoing vessels. documented under the american flag measuring from 1000 gross tons up. the stand- ard oil co. of new. york had -26 seagoing vessels\u00bb under the american flag, and the standard oil co. of cali- fornia had 12 vessels. these fleets gave to the standard oil interests a power in the oil trade that was con- sidered enviable even before the ger- man war, but inasmuch as the stand- ard oil co. of new jersey alone has let contracts for approximately 225,000 deadweight tons of new tankers, the prewar record will soon be surpassed. includes design of large tankers in shipbuilding circles considerable interest surrounded the design of the two largest tankers which are to be built at newport news, especially in- asmuch as they are so far in advance of anything built by english yards. | the designs of the tankers now under construction at the federal yard, how- ever, afford the key to these' plans. the five tankers' building by the federal company, until the newport news contract was let, were probably the largest tankers ever attempted in the united states. the plans and specifications prepared in this instance, it is understood, have been utilized for drafting the design of the big 20,000- ton ships, according to the contract signed with the federal shipbuilding co., the five 15,100-ton tankers to be built at kearny will be constructed according to lloyd's highest classification. they will measure 500 feet between perpen- diculars, have a 58-foot beam, and will be 38 feet 9 inches deep. their loaded draft will be 27 feet 6 inches. these ships will have 19 oiltight, watertight transverse bulkheads, and one con- tinuous oiltight center line bulkhead with the usual expansion trunks. these vessels are the 3-deck, shelter deck type, and the expansion trunks ex- tend from the main to the shelter deck. a cofferdam forward will separate the oil cargo space from a cargo space in the prow which will also carry chain locker and_ stores. room is located amidships and an- other cofferdam half-way between this 495 a pump : speed and advanced labor cost and the forward cofferdam. a third cofferdam will separate the oil cargo space and the space for fuel oil, and a fourth cofferdam will separate the fuel oil space from the boiler room. the engines will be carried aft with a boat deck above, and the bridge and usual deck houses accompanying will be placed forward of the second coffer- dam. a vessel of this class will calry. a crew of over 60 men and the accom- modations for the men are planned according to the oil company's usual high standard. these accommodations are more than the law requires, a separate room being supplied for each officer as well as three spare rooms, two of these spare rooms will have detached baths, and while one is as- signed to a doctor and another to a purser, these officers are not normally carried on ships of this class. the wheel and chart rooms are on the flying bridge forward, below being the captain's cabin, captain's office, and the wireless room. the spares and officers' rooms and dining saloon are below the captain's quarters. the crew will be housed in the stern, over the en- gine room space. three masts will carry the antennae, the forward and the stern mast being fitted with beams and hoists. probably the most important feature of these tankers, however, will be the loading and unloading equipment planned for handling oil. each vessel will have two main cargo oil pumps of the horizontal duplex type. they will be fitted with suction lines 14 inches in diameter, and be capable of discharging at least 3000 barrels per hour at a piston speed not exceeding 100 feet per minute working against a head of 100 pounds per square inch. these are the largest suction lines ever fitted on a tanker and the pumps are supposed to be the most powerful. in addition to these two main cargo pumps, each vessel will be cquipped with one small stripping pump with a separate line 6 inches in diamcter. all deck machinery will be supplied by the hyde windlass co. the twin wheels will be of built-up bronze. the ships will be equipped with two tripie expansion engines, 20% x 35 x 60 wth a 42-inch stroke. making 90-revoiu- tions per minute, these engines shou'd drive the vessels 11.5 knots. each ship have three scotch single-end 16 feet in diameter and 11 will boilers,  496 feet 6 inches long. they will have a heating surface of 9576 square fest, and will be equipped with howden forced draft and mechanical burners. in addition, one large donkey engine boiler, 10 feet 11 inches in diameter and 10 feet 10% inches long will be provided. this boiler will have a heating surface of 1200 square feet. the plans of these tankers were drafted by the engineers of the federal shipbuilding co. in consulta- tion with the naval architects and marine engineers of the standard oil co. -in many respects, the design places their ships among the first rank of tankers turned out by amer- ican yards, and makes the vessels ex- cellent commentaries upon the stand- the marine review bunker stations throughout the world and plans to offer bunker oil to ships plying on all the chief ocean routes. to fill this tremendous demand is proving by no means a small task especially in view of the changed atti- tude of jabor. owing to the high cost of labor, the newer types of standard oil tankers are capable of greater speed and have been equipped to load and unload much more rapidly than those already afloat. these innova- tions have undoubtedly enhanced the cost of the new ships but when every- thing is considered it is anticipated that they will prove more economical. the gulfport shipbuilding co., gulf- port, miss., has obtained contracts for september, 1920 repairs tax capacity the facilities of the yard and the three drydocks of todd dry docks, inc., seattle, are being severely taxed bs general repair work. this plant is receiving an increasing amount of work and the docks are constantly in demand. several exceptionally big repair jobs have been handled this year. the accompany- ing photograph shows five vessels at the yards, three in dock and two moored alongside awaiting their turn. on the left is the shipping board steamer forr wayne moored at the east end of the yard. next is the shipping board steam- ship west harttlanp in the 12,000-ton sectional drydock. the third vessel js the shipping board liner city or spokane repair ards which the industrial line attempts to maintain. tanker tonnage has been in press- ing demand ever since the outbreak of the german war. english and other foreign yards are busy building this class of ships but it is estimated that it will be many years before the supply catches up with the demand. the standard oil co. is branching out upon a program of world-wide ex- pansion, opening new bunker stations and striving to meet the unusual de- mand for oil. these new ships have been specially designed larger than tankers of the past because of this in- creased demand for oil and the in- creasing distances that oil has to be carried. the greater percentage of the new ocean tonnage constructed since the out- break of the german war is oil burn- ing and the demand for bunker oil for ocean navigation alone represents a tremendous demand not before ex- perienced. the standard oil co. has outlined a program for extending its six large working power boats for coast- wise service of the united states gov- ernment. three will be 72 feet long and three 61 feet. the boats will be equipped with high speed gasoline engines, and probably are intended as_ lighthouse tenders. turnover shows g ain messrs. armstrong, whitworth & co., ltd., a large shipbuilding firm of newcastle-on-tyne, england, and glasgow, scotland, are offering for subscription \u00a32,000,000 of 6% per cent second mortgage debenture stock at the price of 95 per cent redeem- able in 25 years. the directors state that although accounts have not been published since 1915, profits for the four years since that date have prob- ably averaged not less than \u00a31,000,- 000 per annum. the chairman of the company in a letter to the stock- holders states that the present rate of turnover is three to four times that of prewar days.

general overhauling after a voyage to the orient while the weeest hartland and city of spokane were docked and overhauled. this yard has also docked the shipping board steamer drasito, as well as a number of large steamers owned by private companies. in addition, todd dry docks, inc., has been awarded several contracts for re- modeling steamers built in japan for the shipping board and delivered here. the steamer c. s. rozinson went ashore below west neebish, soo river, recently when her steering gear became disabled. sixteen, plates were damaged and she put into drydock for repairs. | |  why west coast fears ship act pacific marine interests are alarmed by section 28, foreseeing effective retaliation by foreign lines hile enthusiastic over the w plans for an american mer- chant marine and endorsing almost in its entirety the jones act in- tended to accomplish that purpose, never- theless the pacific coast is deeply con- cerned over the effects which section 28 of that measure may have on the future of shipping from north pacific gateways. while it is true that section 28 has its staunch defenders on the pacific, the majority of shipping opinion on that coast believes that this pro- vision of the law is likely to drive business from the pacific 'coast and send foreign ships to gulf and atlan- tic ports. the fact that the section in question has been suspended for the remainder of 1920 has not tended to quiet the fears of those opposed to the much discussed clause. the pa- cific coast, as it views the law now. will not rest easy until section 28 has been repealed. shipping men of the state of wash- ington are gratified that the senior senator from -that state should have been the prime mover in enacting a bill so comprehensive and containing so many splendid provisions for build- ing up and maintaining a large mer- chant marine under the flag of the united states. the preamble to the bill is considered an excellent outline of what the government should do for its shipping. it is a strange fact, how- ever, that the ports of senator jones' own state and the adjacent common- wealths to the south, fear that section 2% will work an irreparable injury to the shipping of california, oregon and ashington and drive carriers to other sections of the united states. what the west fears because the position of north pacific ports is not understood, it is not strange that the east should be surprised at the opposition on that coast to section \u00ae brielly stated this is the basis of protest : most of the export and import com- modities passing through pacific gate- we are subject to the long trans- ronan rail haul. if the prefer- a ete rates of section 28 are put pte all the foreign carriers now ns to that coast will naturally riven to canadian ports where by br. c. bill no discrimination will be practised or they will be diverted to gulf and at- lantic ports where they can compete on a parity with american vessels. advocates of section 28 reply that it will be well to have none but amer- ican carriers operating out of pacific ports. the answer to this is that ill feeling abroad will be engendered which will be reflected in discriminatory regu- lations against american vessels in other parts of the world. further, for- eign buyers usually nominate the car- riers by which their goods shall be shipped. they will naturally favor their own ships. thus cargo originat- ing in the interior or close to the at- lantic seaboard will be moved to the east and then by the all-water route. the pacific coast will thus lose its shipping. in few words, these are the outstanding arguments of both. sides. to. understand the situation, it' must be kept in mind that a large propor- tion of the cargo loaded. or. discharged at pacific ports is neither of local origin nor is it. consigned to- local points. consequently, much of the com- merce of the pacific gateways will be affected by section 28. of local cargo alone, such as lumber, salmon, salt fish, flour, fruits, coal, grain and canned milk,. there is far from sufficient to fill the ship space now regularly oper- ating out of pacific ports. thousands of tons of manufactured products mar- keted in the orient are moved over- land and shipped from the west coast. likewise great quantities of manufac- tured articles or raw materials are land- ed there for shipment by rail to all parts of the united states. the competition for handling this overland business has always been very keen between the atlantic, gulf and pa- cific ports. panama canal, some business has been diverted to the all-water route between the orient and new york--business, that in the days before the canal moved to seattle or other pacific ports. for years, special rail rates have been al- lowed by the railroads to permit some of this cargo, having its origin or final destination east of the mississivpi, to move across the country and through the pacific terminals. this was advan- tageous to the railroads for it helped to furnish freight for their cars in both directions. the cars that came west 457 ports. since the opening of the with export steel products from the manufacturing centers near pittsburgh returned to the east with pacific lum- ber or oriental imports. otherwise, many cars would have come west emp-_ ty. these rates on through freight are in many cases considerably lower than the domestic rates on the same com- modities. in this manner transpacific trade has been fostered. some of the foreign steamship lines have for years had traffic agreements with american railroads. this special rate structure is designed to preserve q parity of the through ocean and rail combination of rates via both the atlantic and pacific gate- ways. for its foundation, it has the rail rates between representative interior territory and new york plus the ocean rates between new york and the orient. these tariffs are so adjusted as to en- able the transcontinental lines to com- pete against the combination of the do-5 mestic rail rates and the ocean rates -- applying from points on the atlantic seaboard. they also apply on _ the canadian lines between points in the united states and british columbia - east has advantage notwithstanding the low through rates, freight designed for foreign des- tination naturally flows through the at- lantic seaboard and the pacific ports have always had to meet the keenest competition from eastern ports. as an illustration the following table shows the small proportion of freight which was moved across the country as against that passing through new york. on a few of the larger items, customs reports of exports, by value, during the first quarter ef 1920 show the follow- ing totals: from from commodity new york seattle autos 3 $10,650,000 $ 120,500 auto patts.2.-. 1,300,000 30,000 iron and steel ar- ticles 5.1.4.4; 13,000,000 2,500,000 machinery ....... 9,000,000 750,000 cigarets =.,....4- 2,000,000 730,000 it is true that during the period in question, pacific ports were under an additional handicap because of the car shortage and railroad disturbances. all the business mentioned above originat- ed near the atlantic coast and was hauled to new york under regular  498 \u00a9 domestic rates. on the other hand the movement to seattle was under export rates ranging from $1.59 to 62% cents per 100 pounds lower than the domestic rates on the same commodities for the same rail haul. the through rates in both in- stances, that is, through the atlantic and through the pacific gateways to the orient, were practically on a parity. the chief benefit of these export rates is that they form the backbone for the maintenance of steamship service in the pacific and the movement through pacific ports has depended in a large measure on these special rates. with- out the long 'transcontinental haul fur- nished by through freight, the railroads would have to move empty cars long distances thus making an increased trans- portation cost which would naturally be reflected in eastbound transcontinental rates from the north pacific. the chief indictments advanced by the opponents of section 28 are: 1--that it will create ill feeling with foreign nations who will not hesitate to adopt retaliatory measures against american ships when calling at foreign ports. 2--that it is a wrong form of sub- hoy if i is a subsidy at all. it 1s agreed that american vessels must be subsidized but it is contended it should be done in such a way as not to cause international ill feeling and complica- tions. : 3.--foreign and american ships can compete at new york and other eastern ports on equal terms; consequently ship- ping will be diverted from the pacific. 4.--lf section 28 is applied, foreign ships can also be 'diverted to british columbia ports and there enjoy equal privileges. os 5--neither the shipping board nor the interstate commerce commission can control rail rates via the canadian lines except for the small portion of the haul which is within united states territory. 6.--much of the traffic is under rout- ing control of interests favorable to shipping in foreign bottoms. may drive ships away after a careful study of the situa- tion, many of the best informed traffic men on the west coast have reached the conclusion that section 28 will drive shipping from the pacific ports because commerce will naturally flow to those gateways where there is an equality of _ competition between american and for- eign bottoms. because of the short rail haul to atlantic ports, foreign vessels can operate from those terminals on equal terms with united states ships. with the added competition of the all- water haul via the panama canal, pa- ciffe ports can visualize their commerce going to eastern ports. consequently there is a general protest against the section in question. it is further contended that it will be impossible to prevent this disaster to pacific ports if section 28 is en- forced, because there is no requirement the marine review compelling the railroads to give prefer- ential rates to this import and export trafic. \"but if these rates are con- tinued, the rail hauls to the atlantic are so short and the domestic rates on such a low level that no rates could be made which would give substantial prefer- ence to american ships, operating from eastern ports, without being confisca- tory. on the other hand, the canadian lines can continue to compete with the atlantic ports as charges added to the local rates to and from the border junctions would preserve the necessary parity between atlantic and pacific gate- ways. admiral benson's somewhat bellig- erent statement that the interests of the pacific will be protected has not reassured shipping men on that coast. no foreign lines will continue to oper- ate from ports where there is a con- stant menace which upsets the sta- bility of commerce when they can go elsewhere and compete on equal terms. naturally they will take with them the business they control. this loss can- not be recouped by additional sailings of american ships. discount subsidy claim the claim that this measure provides a subsidy is not taken seriously. be- cause of the short rail haul and the parity of domestic and through rates to atlantic ports, american ships will reap no benefits on the east coast. if busi- ness is diverted from pacific united states ports, the american vessels prom- ised for that coast will receive no sub- stantial subsidy. again these prefer- ential rail rates do not create new for- eign commerce but are applied to create a parity between various gateways of the united states. another feature of the transpacific trade is interwoven with the question of transcontinental freight. the com- panies operating from pacific ports de- pend in large measure on steel and cot- ton, coming across country, to load their vessels with the necessary propor- tions of weight and measurement cargoes. local cargo alone would neither fill the fleets operating from there nor furnish the required ratio of weight and. measurement. advocates of section 28 state that the opposition to the section is foreign steamship propaganda, that the foreign companies, having contracts and_ ter- minal leases at local ports, will not move. furthermore, they claim there is sufficient cargo of local origin to keep the foreign lines here. in any event, they add, if the foreign lines leave there will be an all-american fleet to serve pacific ports. these arguments are not based on sound logic for if the same conditions applied to all sections of the united - kisen kaisha will september, 19209 states, the pacific coast would have no complaint. however, it is feared that gulf and atlantic ports wil| get the cargo and the ships that are now on the pacific and it is in a spirit of self-defense that the pacific is protest. ing, although in no degree impugning the motives of the loyal american sena- tor and his colleagues who fathered the bill in a patriotic spirit of desiring to foster the american merchant marine. fore'gn lines hide plans as far as known no foreign lines have either actually moved from pa- cific ports or have announced that such action will result. representatives of foreign fleets absolutely will not discuss the matter. however, it is significant that the following notice has been served by the three big japanese lines to the china-pacific freight conference: \"if the american government sub- jects japanese vessels to discriminatory treatment, the nippon yusen kaisha, the osaka shosen kaisha and the toyo immediately secede from the conference and take free action.\" this has but one meaning. the jap- anese are preparing to cut rates to the bone in an effort to drive american ships from the pacific. already one of the largest british fleets has an- * nounced a material reduction in the hemp rate from manila. one peculiar feature of the situa- tion is that british columbia interests are protesting against the alleged dis- crimination of section 28 and are hop- ing that the law can be evaded. on the united states side, the fear is ex- pressed that trade will be driven to canada. discussing the measure, the vancouver, b. c., sun outlined the british columbia viewpoint as follows: \"by far the greater part of the trans- pacific freight handled through van- couver is destined for or originates in the united states. steel from eastern shipping points to the pacific coast car- ries a rail rate of $12 per ton for ex- port and $25 per ton domestic. the present ocean rate to the orient is $12. under the disputed clause steel could be shipped to the far east for $24 per ton. the best a foreign vessel could do, if forbidden the use of the export rail rate and if the freight had to car- ry the domestic rate of $25 to the pacific coast, would be $35 per ton. \"the effect of this would be to force the canadian robert dollar co., now operating five vessels out of van- couver, to change its boats to american registry. the canadian pacific transpa- cific service would be forced to depend solely on freight secured in canada. the blue funnel liners trading between here and the orient would probably be withdrawn from service. no japanese line could compete with the americans.\"  hip work ends at hog island construction stops at great yard which proved world wonder--main achievements of fae oi built up during the war emergency to \"manufacture\" ships, will pass out of existence with the closing of the current year. the last of the contract vessels has been launched and will be fitted-out and turned over to the emergency fleet corporation by the end of the year, the american international shipbuilding corp., which was or- ganized by the american international corp. for the pur- pose of taking the contract with the government for '\"manu- factured\" ships, will also be dissolved immediately the work is completed. this corporation was capitalized at but $2000 and its demise is important only for the work at hog island. the operating corporation originally owned the land upon which the hog island plant was constructed, but that prop- erty was taken over by the shipping board early in 1920. all the structures on the land were owned by the shipping board. 'in 1917, hog island was a swamp and the year 1921 may display it as one of the magnificent engineering ruins of the world war although various plans for its regenera- tion are advanced. immediately the last vessel was launched in july active work at salvaging the plant began. the derricks on the ways were shored and the hoists removed. all the lost rivets were being recovered with the use of electric magnets. the greater part of the electrical equipment of the yard was sold. ail the surplus and removable material, including the material purchased to construct 35 class b ships which were not built, is to be sold. the yard would make an excellent combination ship- repair, shipbuilding, and terminal plant by using a part h\u00ab island has finished. this spectacular shipyard sept. 13, 1917, contract. for building horsepower and will make a. speed of of the ways for ship construction and placing one or more drydocks of large capacity where the other ways are now located. with a water frontage of 21%4 miles the plant is excellently adapted to these purposes, but the actual fate of the yard is still in doubt. grass is already growing in some of the abandoned ways, and the shipping board is selling to second-hand dealers everything that is removable. it is reputed that some private firms have attempted to obtain title to parts of the yard, but none of the big corporations has indicated a desire for the complete property. apparently it is too large a proposition for any single private agency to swing, and a prospect exists that either the federal government, the state of pennsylvania, or the city of philadelphia will acquire title and put the plant to some commercial use. chairman benson of the shipping board, after declaring that in his opinion hog island was one of the three big outstanding features of the war, said the plant would not be abandoned. hog island was a wartime project, and, as such, more than did its part in the winning of the war. its peacetime effort 'to aid in establishing the american flag on the seven seas also brought to it the glory it deserves. it has ainply demonstrated that quality production of ships is accomplished almost as easily as that of hair-pins, sewing- machines, bolts, or screws, and above all, it demonstrated tliat american ingenuity is not yet dead. its record is one of which maritime america may. well be proud. hog island's history is summarized as follows: eo four or five months to complete. of the hog island shipyard signed by the shipping board. sept. 20, 1917, work of actually build-- ing the vard started. feb, 12, 1918, first keel laid. aug. 5, 1918, the quisrconck, the first ship was launched. by dec. 31, 1918 12 cargo vessels had been launched and ships in various stages of completion were on the other 50 ways. july 21, 1920, the last vessel, the catahoula, was launched, and work of salvaging the yard started in earnest. on aug. 1, 1920, the yard had de- livered 93 of the cargo carriers to the owners, shipyard had 50 ways and_ seven fitting-out piers. the day the last ship was launched, . others were launched with it, within the record time of 87 minutes. a total of 122 ships were built at this e including 110 cargo carriers, 11 \u00b0\u00b0 transports, and one navy aircraft tender, oe ats, known as \"a\" type, a 825 deadweight tons each, are

launched at the plant is 956,750, nearly one-tenth of the entire tonnage of steel ships launched from all the shipyards of the united states in the same period and 50 per cent of the delaware river shipyards' contribution to the new american merchant marine. a ship in 36 hours employing 35,000 men and women when its operations were at the peak, the plant during the year ended july 21, 1920, launched a ship every 3% working: days or 28% working hours and de- livered a complete vessel every 44 working days or 36 working hours. in building the 122 ships, 356,018 tons of- steel were erected and 64,573,- 486 rivets driven into the hulls. placed end to end, the 122 ships launched would reach from market street wharf, philadelphia, down the delaware river to essington, 2 miles below the shipyard, a total distance of nearly 9 miles. july 30, 1920, 29 vessels werd being outfitted in the wet basin of the plant. this work will require approximately 499 all cargo carriers launched, 93 had been delivered to the emergency fleet cor- poration. up to july 25, 1920, the hog island vessels had steamed approximately 2,500,000 miles, and had carried more than 2,500,000 tons of american prod- ucts to all the important ports of the world. to this date, not a single complaint has been made against the vessels, they having delivered their cargoes safely in every instance. the quistconck, the first vessel -launched at hog' island, has steamed 63,000 miles. she was drydocked once after covering 37,500 miles for the pur- pose of scraping and painting the bot- tom of the hull. the vessel has been in constant. service without any diffi- culty whatever, and has never failed nor shown material, structural or work- manship weakness from the day she was launched. the wheels of these ships make 90 revolutions per minute, reduced from 3600 revolutions. the ships each burn approximately 28 tons of fuel oil a day, and have a steaming radius of 15,000 miles. they can each carry 6000 tons of cargo.  ~ y marine business statistics condensed new. york traffic raffic through new york during july established a_ re- cord for the year. both over- seas entrances and clearances represent- ed an approximate increase of 10 per cent over the month previous, and the clearances were larger in number of ships and total net tonnage than the record of last january. there is no measure of the average cost of bunker at new york, although spot bunker coal alongside was selling for from $17 to $18 a ton on aug. 5. the price paid for coal bunker under contract by the liner companies would undoubtedly reduce the monthly av- erage considerably. spot fuel oil was new york port traffic 1920 (exclusive of domestic) --entrances-- --clearances-- ; no. net no. net month ships tonnage ships tonnage panoaiy

higher prices for bunker were due to the en- forcement of the coal restrictions which the government imposed. the larger volume of clearances was in line with the easier movement of export freight to the port by the rail lines, and the check of the longshore- men's strike. these clearances were also made possibly by a better control of bunker supplies. ee icivhie traffic prior to the war, philadelphia's port trafic was predominatingly coastwise. during the first six months of 1920, however, the overseas entrances and clearances exceeded the coastwise busi- ness, thereby ushering philadelphia in- to an important position in internation- al trade. sugar imports continue of importance at this port but miscellane- ous cargoes in both imports and ex- ports were the general rule during july. city authorities are becoming in- terested in the growing trade and some steps are being taken to care for the business. last month the mayor of philadelphia authorized the condemna- tion of a group of old piers north of market street. this property is val- ued at $1,250,000, and it is planned to im- prove the harbor front by constructing here three new double-deck piers at an estimated expenditure of about $3,000,000. . the overseas entrances during july were a good average for the year but smaller than those of either last march or last may. american vessels consti- tuted

--_--_ or marine busi growth of u. s. shipping o' june 30, 1920, the shipping registered, enrolled, or licensed under the american flag, ac- cording to the oficial returns of the bureau of navigation, departraent of commerce, comprised 28,150 vessels of 16,350,000 gross tons. final returns of smaller vessels built, lost, or abandoned will change slightly these figures one way or the other, but probably not to the extent of 100 vessels and 12,000 gross tons. since jan. 1, 1919, closely following the armistice of nov. 11, 1918, american shipping in round num- hers has increased 5,000,000 gross tons, and during the fiscal year just ended the increase has been 3,400,000 gross tons, of which 3,100,000 gross tons are documented in the name of the gov- ernment of the united states, repre- sented by the shipping board. the ac- companying tabie shows the main fea- tures in the growth of american ship- ping since jan. 1, 1918. the seagoing ships of 1000 gross tons or over by which the foreign trade and the more important branches of the coasting trade are conducted are separately stated. the striking feature is the growth of government. ownership through the shipping board, based on the large appropriations by congress for shipbuilding and operation to win the war. such appropriations ceased with the fiscal year just ended, and further additions to the government's fleet will require sales from the prcsent govern- ment fleet to private owners, so that the tonnage under government owner- ship is virtually at its maximum. the last two columns in the table give the quarterly returns for all documented shipping of the united states, including the seagoing ships in the first four. columns. the number and tonnage of american documented merchant vessels on speci- fied dates is given in the table. the fleet of seagoing ships, each over ------------ ----=!\"1 ness statistics condensed ee 1000 gross tons, aggregating 2839 of 10,846,102 gross tons, consists of 2065 steel

\u00a9 determining compass error by amplitude--use { of north star o find the compass error by | amplitude reckoning is even quicker than the method of working it out from azimuth. the compass bearing of the sun, for in- stance, when its center is in the true horizon is observed. true amplitude is the true bearing of a cclestial body at the time of rising or setting. it is reckoned from the east at rising and toward the declinaion and from the west at setting and toward the declina- tion. to the local mean time is combined the longitude in time. naturally, if the longitude of the ship is west the longitude in time is added to the local time, but is subtracted if the longitude at the ship is east. this. gives. the greenwich mean time, and for the greenwich mean time we can find the declination of the sun (or for such other celestial body as may be _ ob- served). in this manner we obtain the correct declination of the sun. the secant of the latitude of. the ship added to the sine of the declina- tion of the observed body will give the logarithmic sine of the true amplitude. bowditch in table 39 gives a ready method of finding the in finding ship's by v. g. iden e e compass amplitude, the error is east. fig. 13 illustrates plotting a compass error that is west. in this figure, the angle woc is the compass amplitude and the angle wot is the true ampli- tude. in this instance, the error is naturally west. having found the compass error, we next find the compass deviation in the same manner as it would be found when reckoning the correction by azimuth, by taking the compass variation into account. take the case of a ship which on nov. 23, 1919, was in latitude 56 degrees 42 minutes north and longitude 49 degrees 45 minutes west. the local mean time was 4 hours and 3 minutes. the com- pass amplitude noted was west 20 de- erees 30 minutes south. the variation of the compass was 41 degrees 20 min- utes west. table viii shows how to find the deviation on the ship's heading. frequently it is desirable to work out a ship's position at night and in this case a navigator will normally take an observaton of polaris, commonly known as the north star. it is possible to work out position by observation of any of the other well known celestial bodies, but polaris is most generally position known and_ recognized. furthermore, polaris is the star toward which the north pole of the earth very nearly points and which accordingly seems fixed and immovable in the sky. it js distant from the pole about 1 degree, 8 minutes. in such calculations, the navigator becomes involved in a varying reckon- ing of time, which is known as sidereal time. sidereal time is measured by the apparent motion of the stars. sidereal time is time reckoned by sidereal days, or, taking the sidereal day as the unit, the time elapsed since a transit of the vernal equinox, reck- oned in parts of a sidereal day. this is, strictly, apparent sidereal time, nrean sidereal time being reckoned from the transit, not of the true, but to the mean, equinoctial point. sidereal time has been calculated by the observatory experts and the results tabulated in the nautical almanac which is offered for sale to navigators by the government. in working out position by observa- tion of polaris, it is first necessary to reduce the recorded time of the ob- servation to the local sidereal time. this is done by adding to the green- wich mean time of the amplitude, when _ the latitude and the declina- tion are known, but for more accurate work this should be figured out by bowditch table 44 from which the log- arithmic sine of the true amplitude is taken. the compass amplitude has already been ob- served and _ naturally the difference between this compass amplitude observation the sidereal time, or right ascension of mean sun. _ this: lat- ter is given in the nau- tical almanac tables of computation for the sun on the date for which the observation is made. in. table 11] of sthe nautical almanac 15 given the number of minutes and seconds for the amount of elapsed time from greenwich and the true amplitude will be the compass error. navigators find it advisable.to plot the true amplitude and the compass amplitude in order to, give the proper designation of direction to the compass error. the rule, when the - two angles are plotted, is that when the true amplitude is to. the left the error is west, and when the true amplitude ss noon. these two sums added to the greenwich mean time gives the greenwich sidereal time. the nautical almanac also gives a table of the apparent places of the stars upon any date of the year. in the table for the upper transit, the right ascension of polaris will be noted in hours, minutes and sec- is to the right of the - fig, 13--plotting a compass error 508 onds. this time is sub- tracted from the green- wich sidereal time  september, 1920 already found, and the remainder will be the hour angle at greenwich. to this hour angle is applied the longitude of the ship reduced to time. if the jongitude is west, it is subtracted and 'f it is east it is added. the remainder will be the hour angle of polaris at the ship. with this hour angle as a_ guide, the declination of polaris is taken from the table giving the apparent places of the stars. prior to this, of course, the observed altitude of polaris has been reduced to true altitude. with the hour angle as the vertical argument, and the apparent declination of polaris as. the horizontal argument, the cor- rection is taken from table i of the nautical almanac and added to or sub- tracted from the true altitude, accord- ing to its sign. the result will be the latitude of the ship at the instant of observation. : take the case of a ship which on sept. 10, 1919, was in longitude 30 degrees 17 minutes west. the true altitude of polaris was found to be 52 degrees 41 minutes 44 seconds out of meridian. the local mean time was 2 hours, 30 minutes and 13 seconds, am. but the time as corrected by chronometer was 4 hours, 31 minutes and 21 seconds, a. m. the latitude at the time of observation is determined as in table ix.

merely because the joiners have received an advance of 12 shillings, about $2.40, per week, the shipbuilding employers' federa- ton has refused the claim of the shipwrights union, to which has been jomed the blacksmiths and_ boiler- makers, to 3. shillings (60 cents) per day advance, and the clyde branches of the union have, therefore, called on their executive committee to de- clare a national

surveys of important activities in maritime centers of island empire the industrial court at glasgow, scotland, has also recently been con- cerned with the hearing of a number of other labor disputes

of official red tape, delay and confusion in its efforts to dispose of america's war-built merchant fleet comes the news that england has sold the last of her government-owned ships. when the war ended the british ministry of shipping, which corresponds to the shipping board, owned 198 merchant vessels. various plans for selling out were suggested. finally the whole proposition was turned over to lord inchcape, chairman of the peninsular & oriental steam navigation co. the ships in question, through sir joseph maclay, the shipping con- troller, were placed in the hands of lord inch- cape en bloc and he made himself personally responsible to the government for the financial success of the transaction. the last ship has now been sold and the whole job completed in about a year. the fleet aggregated about 1,400,- wiis the united states shipping board the hands of private owners. 000, about $900,000 per ship or an average of $125 per ton. the cost to the british government, under lord inchcape's management, was only $4250--prac- tically nothing. a more vivid contrast between the methods of the trained business man, working untrammeled along business lines, and the costly, blundering efforts of an official bureaucracy could scarcely be found. in his great task, lord inchcape was assisted by sir owen phillips and other patriotic british maritime leaders. none of the principals or their associated companies made any profit out of the transaction. the british government is now out of the shipping business and all of the merchant vessels under the british flag are

shipowners who have vessels in the coasting trade, there are wider aspects which affect the smooth and easy working of trade at the larger ports of britain. the ocean going vessels in these ports depend to a great extent on smaller vessels for rapid discharge. without this assist- ance, the warehouses and quays be- come congested and it was this very fact that induced the government last year to introduce the coastwise sub- sidy to attract the small vessels. * k * (yet 15, 115 ships of '663,000 tons were under construction in british yards for norwegian account. the total value of these con'tracts in three consecutive years, including the current year, is estimated at \u00a315,200,- 000 ($60,800,000). by a recent judg- ment in the arbitration court of nor- way, it was' decided that the iron, steel and shipbuilding industries should grant an increase in wages of 25 per cent and it is feared that this will necessitate the placing of orders for new bottoms in foreign countries. it is estimated that with this 25 per cent increase, vessels built in norwegian shipyards would cost 300 crowns ($72) a ton more than if built in england. | merger unites big american fleets \"wnhe

the work. the work done on the det boschetto a somewhat different inasmuch as twin screws were fitted in her. these italian sailers are all small ships, meas- uring approximately 2000 tons and less. rut the engines on the det boscherrto, also southwark-harris, were smaller than the engine on the san guiseppe, the two together being able to drive her 8% knots. some of the advantages mentioned for the auxiliary schooner are (1) the ship saves towboat fees by being able to enter port under her own power; (2) on a deep sea voyage she will be able to make her own way out of dol- drums; and (3) when meeting head winds the engines will give steerage- way. in other words the auxiliary en- gine takes the uncertainty out of sail-: ing, and enables a schooner to maintain a schedule. and, inasmuch as she has an engine aboard, the vessel can be equipped with electric lights, which is no small advantage. the crew of the sailer is not mate- tially increased by reason of the engine. a sailer usually carries an engineer to work her donkey engines. this man is replaced with an engineer who un- derstands the handling of diesel engines, and an assistant is drafted from the sailors in the crew. it is not infre- quently the case that the engineer is put on in place of one other man in l bi aunch bi g wo of the 7500-ton steel carriers, built for owners' account, have been launched by the

sible inasmuch as it is not the prac- tice of auxiliary schooners to use both sails and engines at the same time. some sailing vessels have carried this development to its greatest extent and been converted from sailers to motorships. a case of 'this nature was 'the american motorship katherine, which was formerly the 4-mast british barken- tine, county or linuirucow. she was built by the

month of july closed with a fair increase in coal receipts. ore docks have gained a lit- ile on the waiting fleet, which is not as large as it was a month ago, but the line up at lower lake ports is still big and boats are pretty badly bunched. the increase in the coal movement has not improved the car supply in the ore trade to any ex- tent. representatives of the shippers, railroads, and the interstate commerce commission have worked out a plan to bring the coal movement up to 4000 carsea day for the rest of the season. this is the mark that must be reached in order to meet the requirements of the northwest. under the new plan, which has already gone into effect, all the mines will have to send part of their output to the lake front. a good coal movement would improve _ dis- patch as the car supply would be in- creased and more boats would take up cargoes and would not get around so fast. shipments of ore to lower lake ports in july were 9,638,606 tons, an increase of 465,177 tons over july, 1919, when shipments were 9,173,429 tons. the iron ore movement so far this season shows a loss of 3,530,053 tons compared with the corresponding period in 1918. shipments of ore for the season up to aug. 1 amount to 26,079,111 tons against 25,181,848 tons for the same time last year. grain shippers at lake michigan ports are in the market for small tonnage. the beteht

have originated from the tun, cask of wine, the earliest sys- tem of measuring vessels being simply to count the number of casks or tuns of wine which could be carried and thus obtaining a measure of the internal capacity. in the reign of henry v, a. d. 1422, the first act dealing with the measure- ment of vessels of which any record can be found, required \"keels that carry coals at new-castle to be measured and marked,\" but it is not known how the measurement and markings were at that time carried out. in the year 1679, an act of the british parliament extended the above regulation to the wear, and prescribed that the bowle tub of newcastle, containing 22% gallons winchester measure, and \"al- lowing 21 bowls of coal to be meas- ured by such bowle tub by _ heap measure,' in measuring these river craft. should always be used. the \"keels\" were marked by nails - upon the bulkheads at each end of the cargo space, or by driving nails into the stem and _ stern-post to _ indicate the corresponding load. draft. in the year 1694, another act of the british parliament was passed for the measurement of keels, and a _ weight was then fixed upon as a standard, in- 'stead of a measure. this act required \"keels to be measured by putting into them dead-weights of iron or _ lead, allowing 53 hundredweights to every 'chaldron of coals, and a maximum load of 10 chaldrons or 26% tons.\" the load-line was then marked on the stem, stern and each side amidships. by an act passed in 1775, the fore- going regulations for the tyne and wear were extended to vessels loading coal at all other ports of great britain, but the ton of 20 hundredweight avoirdu- pois was then made the standard weight, instead of the chaldron weight. the foregoing remarks relate 'to river craft only, first rule of measurement the measurement of ships, as tinct from the rough estimates nage which are found in early records, appears to date from the first part of the seventeenth century, and the earliest reprinted from the proceedings of the u. 8. naval institute. dis- of ton- rule which can be found is that given in admiral sir william monson's tracts, published after his death in 1642. it is termed \"a rule to know the burden of a ship: length of keel, 120=teet; breadth in beam, 40 feet; depths in hold, 20 feet; 40x20x120--96,000 and 96;000--100=the burden, 960 _ tons.\" from a book entitled the complete shipwright, written by bushnell in the seventeenth century, we learn that the shipwrights of london on the river thames had a custom of calculating the tonnage of a vessel by the follow- ing rule: \"they multiply the length of the keel into the breadth of the ship at the broadest place, taken from out- side to outside, and the product of that by half the breadth. this second prod- uct of the multiplication they divide by 94, or sometimes 100, and according to that division they are paid for so many tuns.\" bushnell proposed to ascertain the true measure of a ship's ability to carry, by first marking the water line when ready' for sea without any cargo on board, afterward marking the lead- line, and then measuring the cubic con- tent of the body of the ship between these lines. this appears to he the earliest recorded suggestions of a method of. measuring, displacement between the light- and load-lines, but the manner in which it was proposed to estimate this displacement was a crude one. it will be observed that the rule quoted differed from monson's by sub- stituting half of the breadth for the depth of the hold. this was a change much for the worse, but probably the half breadth was taken because the depth could not be measured when the vessel was laden, and for the ships built about the time the assumed pro- portion of the breadth to depth was a fairly correct average. the first tonnage rule embodied in the act of the parliament of england was that given in the act of 1694, which levied certain duties upon seagoing and coasting vessels, and is as~ follows: : ex bxd tonnage = melee 94 where . length l is length of the keel taken within board (so much as she treads the ground). b is the breadth within board by the midship beam, plank to plank. d is the depth of the hold from plank below keelson to the under part of the upper deck planks. two years later the tonnage dues on shipping were repealed, and in that year (1696) the first act providing for the registry of shipping appears to have been passed. in 1720, a rule for the measurement of vessels, which was ultimately known as builders' tonnage, was first legalized in an act intended to prevent smuggling, by prohibiting small vessels of \"30 tons burden and under from carrying spir- its.' this rule differed from that given in the act of 1694, in that half the breadth was substituted for the depth, thus making the rule the same as that previously referred to as the practice adopted by the thames shipbuilders. fostered poor ship designs in 1773, a general rule for the meas- urement of all merchant vessels was made by act 13 george iii, and this, with some slight modifications, con- tinued in force till 1835, and had a most evil effect upon naval architecture. this rule is as follows: (l-- 368 x exe tonnage b.-o:) m; == ------ ------ 94 where length l is taken on a straight line along the rabbet of the keel from the back of the -main sternpost: to a_ perpendicular line from the fore part of the main stem under the bowsprit. b is the breadth from outside to outside plank in th: broadest place in the ship, be it either above or below the main wales, exclusive of all man- ner of doubling planks that may be brought upon the sides of the ship. the principal difference between this- rule and that given in the act of 1720 is the manner of taking the which the latter act defined as \"so much as treads on the ground\"; and as this was probably uncertain in prac- tice, the new length for tonnage was obtained by deducting three-fifths the breadth from the length. thirteen years later, the act of 1773 was supplemented by the law for measuring the length of a vessel when afloat. the length was to be _ taken on the load water line from the back of the stern-post to the front of the main stem, and subtracting from it 3 length, | a a a ad ail aie a al  september, 1920 inches for every foot of the load draft of water for the rake abaft, and three- ffths of the ship's breadth for the rake forward, the remainder being the length of the keel for the tonnage. the effects of the foregoing tonnage rule are generally known; the tendency of a rule which only took into account the length and the square of the breadth being naturally to produce deep, narrow ships, which were not only un- handy, box-shaped vessels, but posi- tively dangerous from their liability to capsize. the old law of 1694, which took the depth into acount, also caused vessels to be built with very full lines, and long after the tonnage rule known as builders' old measurement had been suspended by the new measurement its evil effects remained, for the shipbuild- ers continued to use it to describe their ships, and to build the deep dangerous vessels to show a large carrying capac- ity compared with the builders' tonnage. in 1821, a committee was appointed to revise the tonnage laws, and this com- mittee reported that they would have liked to propose the measurement of the portion of the ship included be- tween the light- and load-lines, but that this method was \"liable to in- superable objection on account of the impossibility of ascertaining the posi- tion of these lines in a satisfactory manner,\" they proposed, however, a rule of internal measurement, in which the mean of five breadths and two depths was taken; these multiplied together and by the length and the product divided by 112 gave the tonnage. no legislation was ever attempted upon the report of this committee. determining internal capacity in 1833, another committee was ap- pointed by the admiralty and the re- sult of their investigations was the tonnage rule known as the \"new meas- \"rement,\" embodied in acts 5 and 6 william oy, 1835. this rule aimed at obtaining the in- ternal capacity of a vessel by the smallest number of measurements, and the use of such a divisor as would sive an average result equal to that by the old rule. the rule may be summarized as fol- lows: ist, fo clear hold. (a) the length of the 'upper deck etween after part of stem and fore part of sternpost was divided into six equal , darts, (b) the depths were measured at the foremost, middle and aftermost points of division from under side of upper deck to the ceiling at the timber strake. tr vessels measured' with a the marine review (c) each of. these three depths was divided into five equal parts, and the inside breadth measured at one-fifth and four-fifths from the upper deck of the foremost and aftermost depths and at two-fifths and four-fifths of the midship depth. he jength of \"the: vescel was measured at half the mid- ship depth from after part of stem io fore part of sternpost. then twice the 521 dividing the product of the mean inside length, breadth and depth by 92.4, ad. \"her = #\u00e9ssels measured while loaded, lene xd tonnage = where 130 l is length of upper deck from after part of stem to fore part of sternpost. b is inside breadth on under side of upper deck at middle of length. --_--_ew-- = ln lit fop tee colmtnon lhterval=-16\/t | pe eee ee , curve of sectional areas l | l ! ] { | 6 a 4 oe km ns jsecr\/on amidship depth added _ to the foremost and aftermost depths was termed the sum of the depths. the upper and lower breadth of the foremost division added to three times the upper breadth and the lower breadth at the midship divi- sion and the upper and twice the lower breadth at the after hee gave the of the breadth. the sum of the depths multiplied by the sum of the breadths and then by the length and the product a vided by 3500 gave the 'oister tonnage. the tonnage of the poop or half-deck was found by fig. 1--dividing length and breadth of vessel for measurement i from under side of upper r ae the pump well to the 2 skin. the tonnage of a poopdeck or raised deck was found by the rule already given and added to the result , found by the above formula. in either: of these rules the allow- ance for engine space in steamers was the product of the length between the two bulkheads, the depth of the side amidships and the inside breadth at two-fifths the depth from the deck, divided by 92.4, and the quotient was deducted from the gross tonnage. 'the \"new measurement\" rule te- mained in force till 1854, but gave rise  522 to a great deal of dissatisfaction, and was never popular. a third committee was appointed in 1849, and they recommended that ton- nage should depend upon the entire cubic content of a vessel measured ex- ternally and including poop, forecastle yand other covered-in spaces. transverse sections were to be measured, and a curve constructed in which the ordi- nates represented to scale the area of each section, and the cubic content was found by calculating the area of this curve. the result was to be divided ' by 35,.and then--multiplied by 0.27, a factor chosen to give a result equal to the average result of the old law. a bill was introduced into parliament in 1850 to give effect to these recom- mendations, but met with so little favor that it was withdrawn. basis of present laws mr. moorsom then proposed, in the latter part of 1850, a scheme for the calculation of tonnage based upon in- ternal measurement, so as to obtain the correct internal capacity of vessels, a register ton being 100 cubic feet of internal measurement. the divisor 100 was fixed upon, both for its convenience and to give a result practically corre- sponding with that under the old law. this scheme is embodied in the mer- chant shipping act of 1854, which with some modifications in details is the ex- isting law for tonnage measurement, and the rules laid down in the act of 1854 may be briefly stated as follows: the tonnage deck is the upper deck in vessels with less than three decks, and the second deck from below in all other ships. the length is measured in a straight line along the upper side of the ton- nage deck from inside of inside plank (average thickness) at the side of stem to the inside of the midship stern tim- ber or plankther, as the case may be~- (average thickness), deducting what is due to the rake of the stern' timber in the thickness of the deck and in one- third of the round beam, and the length so obtained is divided into a number of equal parts according to the follow- ing table: divide into length, feet equal parts ro oe toe ee cls cas 4 above 50 not exceeding 120............ 6 above 120 not exceeding 180............ 8 above 180 not exceeding 225............ 10 bove cog ee ec lek os tins c cess ese 12 at these points in the vessel's length a transverse vertical section of the in- ternal volume is then measured by the following method: the depth at each point of division is measured from a point one-third the round of beam below the deck, or, in the case of a break, from a line the marine review stretched in continuation thereof to the upper side of the ceiling, and if the depth as taken at the midship division does not exceed 16 feet, each depth is divided into four equal parts, and the horizontal breadths measured at each of the points of division, and also at the upper and lower points of the depth, the breadth being taken to the inside of ceiling, allowing an average thickness. by the application of simp- son's first rule, the area of each trans- verse section is then found by multi- plying the second and fourth breadth by 4, and the third by 2; these prod- ucts added together to the first and fifth breadths, and the sum multiplied by one-third the common interval, give the area. if the midship depth exceeds upper deck light and a\/t space l\u00a3rgine foon fig. 2--measuring engine room light and air spaces 16 feet, each depth is divided into six equal parts, the second, fourth and sixth breadths -are multiplied by 4, the third and fifth by 2 and these prod- ucts added to the first and seventh breadths, and this multiplied by one- third the common interval, give the area. having obtained the area of each transverse section, the register tonnage is computed as follows: member the af\u00e9as, 1, .2, 3, etc. no. 1 being at the extreme limit at the bow and the. last number the extreme limit at the stern; then multiply the second and every even-numbered area by 4, and the third and every odd-numbered area, excepting the first and the last, by 2, add these products together and to the sum add the first and last if they yield anything; multiply the quan- tity thus obtained by one-third the common interval between the areas, and the product will be the cubical con- tents of the space under the tonnage deck; divide this product by 100, and the quotient will be the tonnage under the tonnage deck. fig. 1 illustrates the manner in which the length and depth of the vessel are divided for measurement. in vessels fitted: with partial double bottoms for water ballast .and also in cases where the inner bottom is not horizontal, but sloping upward toward the side, additional subdivisions and september, 1920 measurements are made in order\" to calculate the internal capacity of the vessel. peak tanks, constructed for carrying water ballast only, and not available for cargo or stores, are, under certain conditions, allowed to be deducted from the gross tonnage. having ascertained the tonnage un- der the tonnage deck, there are various additions to be made to obtain the gross register tonnage, and deductions to be made from the gross to give the net register tonnage, upon which dues and charges are based. the act provides that if there be a break or poop or any permanent en- closed-in space on the upper deck ayail- able for cargo or stores or for the berthing or accommodation of passen-_ gers or crew, the tonnage shall be ascertained thus: measure the internal mean length of such spaces in feet and divide it into equal parts; measure at the middle of its height three inside breadths--namely, one at each end, and the other at the middle of the length, then to the sum of the end breadth add four times the middle breadth and multiply the sum by one-third the common interval between the breadths; the product will give the mean _hori- zontal area of such space; multiply this product by the mean height, and divide by 100, and the quotient will be the tonnage which is to be added to the under deck tonnage, subject to the following provision, that nothing shall be added in respect cf any _ building erected for the shelter of deck passen- gers, and approved by the board of trade, rules for extra decks ifthe ship has a third deck; th\u00e9 space between it and the tonnage deck is found by dividing the length into the same number of intervals as used in computing the tonnage under the tonnage deck, and having found the mean horizontal area of the space by the rule already given, this mean area multiplied by the mean height and divided by 100 gives the tonnage of the 'tween deck space, to be added to the tonnage already found for the por- tion below the tonnage deck; and if the vessel has more than three decks, the tonnage of each space between decks above the tonnage deck is similarly - calculated. hatchways over cargo holds are also measured, and any excess above 0.5 per cent of the remaining gross tonnage is added to the gross tonnage. the merchant shipping act of 1854 also gives a rule for ascertaining ap- proximately the tonnage of a_ vessel \"measured for 'any purpose other than registry,\" and having cargo on board;   september, 1920 also to ships measured for registry, but to which it is impossible to apply rule i. rule ii is as follows for wooden ships: g+bn, tons under deck=( 5 xl x.0017, where l is length on upper deck from out- side of outer plank on stem to perpendicular line from aft of rabbet in sternpost, just below where the counter plank crosses b = outside breadth of ship. g is outside girth of ship from height of upper deck at one side to height of upper deck on oppo- site side. the gitth is taken by means ots chain passed under keel of the ship. for an iron ship the same rule is used, but the final multiplier is 0.0018. to the result found as above has to be added the tonnage of poops or other spaces above the upper deck, which is simply found by dividing the product of the mean length, breadth and depth by 100. in the act of 1854 the multipliers for wooden and iron ships were, respectively, 0.0018 and 0.0021, but as these were found to give results largely in excess of rule i, the factors were altered in 1858 to those given above. the principal use of rule ii was to find the tonnage of foreign vessels for payment of dues previous to the adop- tion of the moorsom system by other nations. net register tonnage from the gross tonnage found, as al- ready indicated, there are certain deduc- tions to be made in order to obtain the net register tonnage. the allowances on account of pro- p\u00e9lling space are briefly as follows: paddle vessel, in which the tonnage of the space solely occupied by and necessary for the boilers and machinery is above 20 per cent and under 30 per cent of the gross tonnage; in screw steamers, in which the tonnage of such space is above 13 per cent and under 20 per cent of the gross tonnage, a deduction of 32 per cent of the gross tonnage is allowed. as regards all other ships that are under or over above percentages, the actual space occupied by boilers and machinery may be measured, and in paddle vessels the allowance is 1% times the actual space, and in screw steamers 134 times the actual space. i screw steamers the contents of the shaft trunk are deemed to form part of the engine and boiler space. oey merchant shipping (tonnage) oe the allowances for propelling a \u20ac will in the future be limited for vessels (except those used exclu- 'act of 1889, which. provides the marine review sively as tugs) to 55 per cent of the tonnage remaining after deducting from the gross tonnage any deductions allowed under section 79 of the prin- cipal att top master's and crew's ac- commodations, navigation spaces, boat- swain's stores, donkey engine and boiler, peak tanks, etc. allowance for crew space the rule for measuring engine and boiler. space provided for the inclusion of light and air spaces above the crown of the engine room and the intention of the act was clearly to provide for such spaces, as indicated in bigg. .2. spaces were, however, framed in above the upper deck, as shown, but by the act of 1854 could not be measured in the gross tonnage. in 1879 the owners of the steamer bo\/slom of kee\/ fig. 38--curve of displacement isabella contended that this upper space should be included in the engine room space, and their claim was al- lowed as being justified by the terms of the act. a 'reduction. in tonnage was consequently obtained on _ this ground, but this was corrected in the that in the future such spaces as those indi- cated must be included in the gross tonnage. besides the allowance for propelling power in steamers, all vessels may have a deduction made on account of crew space. to obtain the allowances under this heading the crew space must be in- spected and approved by a surveyor appointed by the board of trade, and provided not less than 72 cubic feet of space or 12 feet of deck area are set apart for each seaman or apprentice. an act passed in 1867 allows the actual cubic. content of all spaces occupied by the crew except the master to be deducted from the gross tonnage. in the act of 1854 all spaces above the upper deck for the sole accommo- dation of the crew were exempted from measuiement; but the act of 1867 pro- vided for the exemption of crew spaces below th\u00e9 upper deck, and omitted to repeal the exemption under the act of 1854. a the effect of this was that if the crew were berthed above the deck the space occupied was exempted from measurement by the act of 1854, and then by the act of 1867 allowed to be sag deducted from the gross tonnage: or, in other words, allowed for twice. the owners of the steamer isabella, already referred to, raised this point in 1879, and obtained judgment in their favor and since then-a number of other ves- sels have obtained similar reductions in the net register tonnage. the act of 1889 repealed the clauses of the act of 1854 dealing with \"crew spaces,\" so that in future no reduction will be made for such spaces, unless they first have been included \"in the measurement of gross tonnage. this act also provides for the fol- lowing deductions: _l. sailing ships: any space exclu- sively used for storage of sails, not exceeding 21%4 per cent of the gross tonnage of the ship. 2... any. ship: (a) any space used exclusively for the master, (b) any space used exclusively for the working of the helm, capstan and anchor gear, or for keeping charts, signals, and other instruments of navigation and _ boatswain's' stores, cc) the space occupied by the don- key engine and boiler, if \u00a2on- nected with the main pumps of the ship. (d) any other space (other than double bottom) adapted only for water ballast. these deductions are allowed pro- vided the spaces referred to are certi- fied by a board of trade surveyor as reasonable in extent and efficiently con- structed, and they must be permane.tly marked so as to show the purpose for which they are intended. measuring deck cargo ~by the merchant shipping act of 1876, provision is, made for the measurement of space occupied by deck cargo as follows: if any ship engaged in the oversea trade carries cargo in any space on the upper deck which has not been measured under the act of 1854, the tonnage of the. space occupied by the cargo is to be measured and added to the taxable tonnage. this regulation gives a variation in the taxable ton- nage from one voyage to another. the usual definition of home trade taken in this act, is the coasts of the united kingdom and those of the continent from the elbe to brest. the danube international commis- sion adopted in 1860 the moorsom sys- tem of measurement, and subsequently accepted a method of allowance for propelling space as follows: the actual machinery space was meas- ured exclusively of bunkers, and 1% times that space allowed for paddle steamers and 134 times for screw steamers, subject to the total allowance not exceeding 50 per cent of the gross tonnage, except in tugs. this is usual-  524 ly termed and known as the danube rule. another rule, known as the german rule, is to measure the coal bunkers as well as the machinery space, and to allow the total space thus occupied provided it does not -exceed 30 per cent of the gross tonnage, except in _ tugs. in 1873, an international commission on tonnage met at constantinople to deal with the subject of the suez canal dues, and although they adopted the moorsom system of measurement, they made more stringent regulations as to the measurement of deck erections and allowance for engine space. double bottoms for water ballast, whether con- structed on the cellular or system, macintyre are exempted from measure- drilling rivet holes ment in the same manner allowed by the english law. the. suez canal rules for measure- ment of deck erections will not be discussed here as they. can easily be learned from those rules. the danube commission accepted, in 1876, the suez canal rules, so that the same certificate is now available for both. in vessels with fixed coal bunkers, the german rule may be used for ob- taining the allowance for propelling space, while vessels with shifting bunk- ers are measured by the danube rules, and the maximum allowance for crew spaces, galley spaces, w. c.'s and navi- gation spaces is 5 percent of the gross tonnage. the moorsom tonnage measurement has been adopted by most of the mari- time nations of the world, although the allowances for engine space differ in some cases, and the crew space deduc- tions for nearly all countries are lim- the marine review ited to 5 per cent of the gross tonnage. freight tonnage is simply a measure of cubical capacity, a freight ton being 40 cubic feet of space. this tonnage has no legal authority, but is largely used by merchants and shipowners as a measure of the capacity of vessels. register tonnage is a measure of a vessel's internal capacity, a register ton being 100 cubic feet. of itternal space. displacement is a measure of the weight of a vessel and her outfit and cargo, a ton of displacement being 20 hundredweight avoirdupois. the weight ofa floating body is equal to the weight of fluid displaced, and in order, therefore, to ascertain the weight of a vessel and her contents at any given draft, it is only necessary q in huge boiler head to calculate the weight of the volume of fluid displaced. as the register tonnage is that upon which a vessel has to pay dock and other dues, while the deadweight carry- ing capacity represents the earning power of an ordinary cargo vessel, it is obvious that from a shipowner's point of view the most profitable ves- sel is the one which can carry the greatest amount of cargo in relation to her register tonnage. the method of estimating the official tonnage known as the \"builder's old measurement rule\" in which the square of the breadth entered into the calcu- lations while the depth was neglected fostered the. building of dangerously narrow and deep ships with very full forms, so as to produce a large carry- ing power with a comparatively small official tonnage. the present tonnage laws aim at ascertaining accurately the internal capacity of the vessel, and there is not september, 1920 now the same inducement to build such badly proportioned ships. the displacement of a vessel is calcuy- lated from the drawings, and _ the method of calculation is similar in prin- ciple to that adopted for the measure- ment of the internal capacity; but the naval architect is not fettered by any definite number of subdivisions as laid down in the tonnage laws. the area of each section is calcy- lated by means of simpson's rules and the areas of these sections then treated as ordinates of a curve of sectional areas, the result being the volume in cubic feet. to this volume must be added the volume of any appendages, such-~ as keel, rudder, etc., so as to obtain the total volume displaced. thirty-five cubic feet of salt water weigh 1 ton; if, therefore, the volume in cubic feet be divided by 35, the result will be the displacement in tons, it is usual in carrying out this calcu- lation to arrange the ordinates of the various sections and waterlines on a sheet in such a manner that the areas of each may be readily ascertained and at the same time to calculate the center of buoyancy, or the center of gravity of fluid displaced, and to construct curves of displacements and tons per inch immersion. the curve of displacement is con- structed by setting off the displacement -as calculated at different drafts (mean), or ordinates of -a curve on any con- venient scale, so that the displacement at any intermediate mean draft may be ascertained without the labor of separate calculations, by simply measur- ing with the same scale the length of the ordinate at any given draft. the curve of. displacement is usually as shown in fig. 3, and is, of course, only to be used for obtaining the displace- ment at any mean draft of a vessel on a fairly even keel. the displacement at any exceptional trim would have to be calculated separately. rolls big boiler head the largest, single-piece boiler head ever made was recently rolled in the coatesviile, pa. mills of the lukens steel co. for -the. bath iron: workg, bath, me. . the illustration shows the drilling of rivet holes for two of these boiler heads. these were flanged at the mills. the circular plates from which they were made were 199% inches in diameter before turning the flange. the material is 48-inch thick and the completed head weighs 8820 pounds. after turning the flange, the outside diameter was 183 inches. the boilers when completed are to be used in vessels now building at the bath iron works. i a a ea ae ie ink sl  handling bulk cargoes on coast improvements are being made in methods of loading and unloading coarse freight--new equipment ordered \u00ae the past four years, ) several factors stimulated interest among shippers of heavy bulk materials in a cheaper and more rapid scheme of handling such commodities. the manufacturers of apparatus, especially the pioneers in this line, started 4 movement in this direction some 20 years ago, and succeeded in getting 4 limited number of plants installed as early as 1902. the development of plants for handling large tonnages of coal and iron ore was the most obvious necessity and it was naturally the first problem attacked on a large scale. the necessity for such. devel- opment centered around the great lakes region and the pioneer installa- tions were put in that vicinity. the short season of navigation for carrying ore' from the minnesota, wis- consin and michigan fields to the blast furnaces of the lower lakes and the pittsburgh district, requires a move- ment of 12 months's supply of ore in about seven months. the coal sup- ply of the states bordering on the iron ore region is largely. taken from the lower lakes on the return trip of the ore boats. in order to perform this task with the minimum of equipment and at lower operating costs per ton, it was plainly neces- sary to provide machinery for cheap and rapid discharge of cargo from ship to. dock -or railroad \"and vice versa, the length of time the ship was tied up to the dock being a vital factor in costs. the result has been a high state of development and con- centration of bulk cargo handling plants in the lake region. in the late nineties, the wellman- seaver-morgan co., cleveland, brought out its ore unloader, each machine being capable of handling ore at from 500 tons per hour upward. at about the same time the car dumper, for overturning standard railway cars and dumping their contents, was developed. the latter have been evolved until at present they will handle 30 dumps per hour and upward, some installa- tions handling as much as 3000 tons per hour of net material, two cars in tandem. conditions largely due to the great war caused a more general interest to be developed along the coasts in these - methods. prior to america's partici- pation in the war, a few installations had been made on the atlantic coast especially in the line of loading cargo and bunker coal. rising labor costs and necessity of: rapid \"turn around\" on the comparatively few vessels available brought the issue of im- proved dock facilities to the forefront. it was a question of time, tonnage capacity over a given waterfront, and cost per ton. all the above items in the problem are satisfactorily an- swered by equipment of the type previ- ously mentioned, and solve what is still more vital, the item of labor, which in normal volume is unobtain- able at any price. two contracts recently secured. by the wellman-seaver-morgan co. on the atlantic coast are interesting at this time. a contract with the lehigh valley railroad covers an automatic ore unloader carrying a 15-ton clam-- shell bucket on the unloader leg and designed to make a complete cycle or round trip in 50 seconds. the ma- chine, electrically operated through- out, is illustrated in fig. 1. this view, together with fig. 2, illustrates the general appearance of similar ap- paratus in action. the automatic unloader illustrated is unique in design and. has_ proved through many years of service to be one of the most successful devices for unloading ore cargoes from steamers with suitable hatches that has ever. been devised. although of immense proportions, the design has been sim- fig. 1--ore unloaders at work on lake bulk = 525 freighter  526 \"the marine review tg fig. 2--unloader leg plified and the control perfected to such @ point that the machine is easily controlled and operated. the unloader consists of a main framework mounted on trucks which travel along the runway rails located approximately as shown in the pho- tograph,. lhe main framework ex- tends back beyond the rear runway over a temporary storage pile where the ore can be discharged if desired. fis then picked up by the ore bridge and carried to the stockpile. between the front and rear runways, space is provided for railroad tracks where ore carrying cars are placed under the machines and loaded with ore for transportation to the furnace plants. _the girders of the main framework form a support for run- way rails, on which a trolley travels. this trolley supports a balanced walk- ing beam, from the outer, end of which a stiff bucket leg depends. at the lower end of this leg is the buck- et, which is operated by machinery lo- cated on the walking beam. all hori- _zontal movements of the bucket are accomplished by means of moving the trolley backward and forward on the girders. the vertical movements of the bucket are accomplished by the operation of the walking 'beam. the forward portion of the beam being out of balance, the bucket descends by gravity as soon as the brakes of the hoisting mechanism are released. only two operators are required for the entire operation of one of these machines. one of the operators, whose station is in the bucket leg di- rectly over the bucket shells, controls and bucket in hold of ore carrier all of the motions of raising and low- eting the bucket, of 'traveling . the trolley back and forth, and moving the machine along the dock from one hatch to another. the second oper- ator is stationed in a cab on the larry and from this station he controls the movement of the larry, the operation of the larry gates, and the weighing oi the ore. some idea of the capacities for un- loading by this method may be de- rived from a record which was made in ashtabula, o., by eight machines september, 1920 of this type having a capacity of 15 tons each. they unloaded seven boats having a total capacity of 70,000 tons, in 22 hours actual time. at other points, four machines working in boats having capacities up to 13,000 tons each, have unloaded these cargoes jn about 3 hours and *25 minutes, cleaning up a hold in addition. to the vertical move- ment, which is given to the bucket leg by means of the walking beam, it also has a motion of rotation around | its vertical axis. this motion is intro- duced to enable the machine to reach along the keel of the boat and clean up ore between -hatches, the dis tance from point to point of bucket shells when open is approximately 21 feet. about 97 per cent of the ore is removed from the boat without hand labor, records of 50 machines in operation are said to indicate that this type of machine will handle ore at 2% to 4% cents per ton including all fixed charges, and records of as high as 783 tons of ore per hour per machine from tie-up to cast-off of boat have been made. the lehigh ore unloader will be installed at the claremont terminals, new york harbor, to handle chilean and cuban ore. a~ cost of pig iron lower than that based on minnesota ore is predicted due to economies ef- fected, a contract with the western mary- land railroad at port covington, balti- more, covers a wellman car dumper to handle 100-ton road cars. it is the 'fig. 3--lifting type car dumper loading coal at lake port  september, 1920 frst electrically operated lifting dump- er for seaboard coal

national marine league and under the management of the general. expositions co \u00ab\u00a9 phe marine league is now preparing a program of public functions to be scheduled for the week as a means of drawing the attention of the public to the exhibition. as announced by the league, the object of the chicago show is threefold: first--to focus the attention of the voting population of the middle west on the great and constantly increasing importance of america's merchant sea power in relation to the maintenance of inland prosperity. : second--to impress the public of the entire country with the wealth and magnitude of our lake and inland water shipping, to the end that this part of the nation's transportation problem may receive the serious and intelligent atten- tion of both national and state law- makers. third--to provide a market place where buyer and seller of ships, service and marine equipment may conveniently meet and do _ business. the more serious problem of the needs of the overseas trade will not be overlooked. in commenting upon this phase of the subject which is to be accented at the chicago show, p. h. w. ross, president of the marine league, said: : oa man who is running a mill or a farm in america and who wishes to have the sale of his product protected to some extent from ruinous foreign competition thinks of the tariff as the 527 million tons will be handled annually with a probable increase to twice that capacity later, these typical plants indicate the progress of the basic industries, and the gradual elimination of hand labor, which is then diverted to more useful and productive work. these plans also indicate that beneath the surface froth of labor unrest and business uncertainty of the day, there is a con--- stant current of. accomplishment and confidence. the former are merely the phenomena of a business cycle; the latter is the country's foundation. only form of protection. he is mis- taken. \"when his country is in debt to the rest of the world, the tariff works fairly well, but when his country is a creditor and the rest of the world owes america billions of dollars, then the tariff is but poor protection for two reasons: the rate of exchange runs so high against an overwhelm- ingly creditor nation that the ex- change itself will leap over the highest tariff wall a country could ever erect. secondly, an outside world that is heavily our debtor, is forced to pay its debts to us in manufactured goods of one kind or another or in raw mate- rials, protecting national prosperity \"these payments 'in kind' fall upon our shores and in a very few years will deluge our country with cheap for- eign made goods to such an extent as to swamp the manufactories of iili- nois, iowa, indiana and indeed the whole country, unless we have ships of our own. \"the one solution to this grave eco- nomic problem is american ships. through them this threatened deluge of foreign-made goods which could wipe out our steady, profitable em- ployment of capital and labor at home, can be stemmed and diverted to new foreign markets. if we are to retain national and individual prosperity and avoid commercial peonage to any for- eign nation, we must make a concert- ed effort immediately to place our great new merchant marine and the enormous industries connected there- with, in a position where they will not again dwindle to prewar insignificance. \"the development of a _ deep-sea merchant marine is no longer of direct concern only to those states lying on the edge of the ocean. that vast interior region of the coun- try is interested in shipping.\" for today all \u00a9 aoe iei esis rc eater asbestos  equipment used afloat, ashore simplifies drive in radial drill--pipe strainer everal radical changes from ma- chine tool design have been made * in a new line of radial drills re- .cently placed on the market by the niles-bement-pond co., 111 broadway, new york. as shown in the accom- panying illustrations, the most distinc- tive feature is the patented double celumn which adds to the general rigidity of the machine and permits the drive to be so simplified that a higher per- centage of the horsepower is delivered at the spindle. the column is a_ single casting formed of two box section mem- bers cast integral at the top and bottom, the arm saddle being mounted between them. the motor is mounted on the back of the arm saddle and drives the spindle through a single horizontal shaft running between the column members, thus eliminating a number of the usual driving gears and shafts. the arm is easy to swing, the entire weight of the arm and column being supported on ball bearings at the bot- tom of the column, while side thrust is taken on roller bearings. by means of a motor-operated de- vice the column can be instant- ly clamped rigidly to the ped- estal. an operating switch is placed on the drill head fig. 1--end view of drill looking through and a lever for hand clamping is provid- ed on base. the electric clamp is operat- ed by a small motor through a worm wheel and nut and is self-adjusting, wear being taken up automatically. as this clamp is operated by electricity instead of air, it uses the same source of power as the driving motor. therefore, when installing these machines, no considera- tion: need be given to a compressed air supply. to give proper resistance to the drill- ing pressure, the arm is of a new section. the most important features are an upper narrow guide for the saddle and the lower bearing set in a plane back of the front surface. this construction brings the driving shaft closer to the spindle and gives a greater depth from the front to the back of the arm, the result being a stiff arm. the arm is raised and lowered by power from the driving motor operat- ing through the stationary elevating screw and a revolving nut in the arm saddle. starting is ac- complished by _ en- gaging the clutch lever located on the driv- ing gear box and = stop- ping by the controller handle on' the drill head. to prevent engaging the elevating mechanism while the arm js clamped or vice versa, the two me- chanisms are interlocking. safety stops guard against overtravel. a most important advantage of the double column construction is that the drive can be made so that only four gears and one double-faced pinion are required from the motor to the spindle. fig. 4 shows a diagram of the drive. a motor control lever is carried on the head. eight positive geared feeds are secured by setting a disk showing the feed for each position. the feed change gears, which are entirely en- closed and run in oil, may be removed as a unit, [his machine' is built 1 several sizes to meet various specifica- tions. the newburgh

\"the disturbing situation of europe and par- ticularly the critical posture of the great mari- time powers, requires that we should not overlook the tendency of a war, and even of preparations for a war, among the nations most concerned in active commerce with this country, to abridge the means, and thereby at least enhance the price, of transport- ing its valuable productions to their proper markets. \"i recommend it to your serious reflection, how far and in what mode it may be expedient to guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements to our own navigation as will ren- der our commerce and agriculture less dependent upon foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very mo- ments most interesting to these great objects.\" the president who delivered this address was george washington. the congress addressed was the first in the country's history. the date was dec. 8, 1790. transportation ranks next to production \"in the emergency of war we have constructed a tonnage equalling our largest expectations. its war cost must be discounted to the actual values of peace, and the large difference charge to the war emergency, and the pressing task is to turn our assets in tonnage to an ageticy of commerce. \"it is not necessary to say it to congress, but i have thought this to be a befitting occasion to give notice that the united states means to establish and maintain a great merchant marine. \"our differences of opinion as to a policy of up- building have been removed by the outstanding fact of our having builded. ee _\"manifestly if our laws governing american activi- ties on the seas are such as to give advantage of those who compete with us for the carrying of our own cargoes and those who ought naturally come in american bottoms through trade exchanges, then the spirit of american fair play will assert itself to give american carriers their equality of opportunity. this republic can never realize its righteous as- pirations in commerce, can never be worthy the tradi- tions of the early days of the expanding republic until the millions of tons of shipping which we now possess are co-ordinated with our inland transporta- tion and our shipping has government encourage- ment, not government operation, in carrying our car- goes under our flag, to every world market. \"it will strengthen american genius and manage- ment to have it understood that ours is an abiding determination, because carrying is second only to production in establishing and maintaining the flow of commerce to which we rightfully aspire.\" this message was delivered by the latest presiden before the latest congress, being a part of president harding's personal address to congress on april 12. anxious to meet a national need this comparison of the official utterances of the first and latest american presidents has an interest beyond the mere parallel of thought. president wash- ington was addressing a nation whose citizens were largely interested in shipping as a means of livelihood. his views as supported by congress, gave the united states the merchant marine which a century ago was. in the front rank of the world's commercial fleets. president harding addresses a nation most of whose citizens had for years forgotten the fixed rela- tion of commercial ocean independence to the pros- perity of a country itself. the war taught the lesson that washington foresaw in 1790. president hard- ing calls attention to the necessity of interpreting this lesson in time of peace. the new chief executive has carried into the white house the same sincere interest in merchant marine problems which has marked his entire public life. his emphatic declaration in favor of a great merchant marine carries with it an assurance of a suc- cessful solution of this half-century-old problem. the country needs a merchant marine. a president has finally been obtained who intends to meet that need. 205  tical ur of ship problems- analysis of economic and commercial questions which will affect america's new merchant fleet if we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could better judge what to do and how to do tt. hese clear and_ simple words, spoken over sixty years ago in re- lation to a great national problem, apply, in equal degree, to the situation which confronts the commercial world, as an aftermath of the great war. modern civilization is, at the base, in- dustrial. commerce is, from its nature, dependent upon production. it follows that profitable commerce is impossitle ex- cept it go hand in hand with prosperous and productive industry. the late war effected an appalling de- struction of the instruments of produc- tion, among all the greatest industrial nations. this destruction has carried in its train disorganized commerce and finance. ' progress toward normal conditions, the underlying causes of the present situation must be diligently sought, clearly under- stood, stripped of generalities and jar- gon and bravely confronted. as applied to the present world situa- tion in ocean shipping, the babel of voices is quite as incoherent and confus- ing as in other directions. here, too, we have the familiar mental confusion be- tween cause and effect. for instance, the statement that the chief obstacle to our export trade is the depression in european exchange, is about as illuminating as to say that measles result from spots on the skin. the depression in foreign exchange is far less a cause than a symptom. to us, rates of foreign exchange simply mean before we can hope for sound - by robert edwards annin the market values of foreign currencies expressed in terms of our own. our own currency is now on a gold basis; that is, all of our government cur- ahvuuuuueuncuateceuuuuoquouoooueuuooqeeuonuouetorlec ouest what series will show n the series, which starts with this article, mr.- annin will present a practical analysis of the problems of the new american merchant marine. this analysis covers not only the im- portant political and legislative phases of the subject but also the actual op- erating problems which demand solu- tion before success will meet america's new entry into the field of worldwide ocean competition. mr. annin has the fundamental training essential for dis- cussing this subject, based on nearly thirty years of actual experience in op- erating ships. his ability to analyze to- day's problems is evidenced by the books on shipping subjects which he has written. the serics will prove of value to anyone interested in america's marine future, whether as a student or as an executive charged with the task of keeping the new merchant fleet in serv- ice or, like above, of building ships. souths rencies are, on demand, redeemable in gold. european currencies are below the parity of ours because they cannot be now redeemed in gold. the capacity of european nations to produce marketable commodities has been so reduced by war that their surplus val- ues (after supplying their own immediate needs) are insufficient to offset the value 206 of foreign goods which they urgently re. quire. again, since this distorted relation of production to consumption has existed for some years, some of our most valu- able customers abroad have already ex. hausted their credits. to sum up, such. customers cannot pro- duce at home sufficient to fill their needs. and for what they require from abroad they can neither pay (in cash or com- modities) nor obtain credit. therefore, relief from the present de- pression in ocean freights can only fol- low the revival of industry, defla- restoration of cred- interna- tion of itss = and currency, the resumption of tional trade under something approaching normal conditions. to look for a profit- able ocean traffic, previous to material im- provement in all these respects, is simply to expect that effect will precede cause. this situation is serious enough. but european conditions have been aggra- vated by an immense over-speculation in certain lines--for example, freights, coal and sugar. about the middle of 1920 the world's markets, in these and other com- modities, collapsed, bringing many sup- posedly strong interests, here and abroad, to or over the edge of bankruptcy. the influence on ocean freights was instantaneous. in less than a year trans- atlantic rates, for instance, have de clined from a point which showed 4 profit of from $8 to $10 per cargo tom after covering interest, depreciation and repairs, to a level which shows a loss of from $2 to $3 per cargo ton, allow- ing nothing for those items. as europe has so little to export, our ships must come back either in ballast  ee ee may, 1921 or with cargoes the freights on which will barely pay the cost of fuel; so that a vessel carrying 5000 tons outward and returning in ballast will show a cash loss of from $10,000 to $15,000. ocean freights are today on a basis where the gross freight lists cannot cover the cash paid out for operating expenses. it results that merchant ships of all flags have been and are now being retired from service, because \"lay-up\" involves smaller loss than operation. even the norwegians; who can operate their ships at least cost, are putting them out of com- mission. coming to the fleet owned by the american taxpayers--the shipping board fleet--a large proportion is now idle. more ships are likely to be laid up be- fore any material improvement in condi- tions is probable. adding this to the idle fleets of europe and japan, and sur- veying the world conditions in industry and finance, it is clear that no immediate recovery in freights is to be anticipated. . the laid-up fleet must hang as a threat over the freight market until the re- stored commerce of the world shall gradu- ally absorb the idle tonnage. hence, the american 'taxpayer has on his hands about ten million tons of ships which cost him big mnoney whether they be operated, sold or scrapped. this is where we are. whither are we tending? the answer to this question depends altogether upon the attitude of the amer- ican taxpayer toward the maintenance of a merchant marine under the american flag. continue or quit the greatest shipowners in the world are the american taxpayers. collectively they own the greatest single merchant fleet in history. it is paid for, or must be paid for, and the question of its dis- position must be answered by them or through their representatives. shall we hold or quit? there is a plausible argument in favor of quitting. ships are today a liability rather than an asset. to lay up an ordi- nary cargo ship is only less custly than to operate her. certain expenses may be avoided by lay-up, such as wages, sub- sistence, fuel, port charges, loading and discharging, etc. but interest, deprecia- tion and repairs will continue and sooner or later must be written off whether the 'hips be kept in commissio: or not. but the actual losses of operation could be saved by refusing to operate. the fleet then could be laid up until there should be a market for tonnage, and sold as opportunity might offer, on such terms as might prove practicable. the loss would have to be written off like other war costs. in that case our ocean traffic could be expected to gradually resume marine review the. position which it occupied before 1914--that is, there would be few of our ships afloat outside of our coastwise and - colonial trade. in spite of the appalling immediate loss that would have to be faced, this is prob- ably the least expensive course to pur- sue. moreover, the loss would be less than appears at first glance. <a certain proportion of the fleet will never pay operating costs in normal markets. such ships can neither be operated nor sold. they are already a loss. many of them will never earn their repair bills, these need not be considered in planning the disposition of the fleet, for under any probable circumstances they will always cost more than they can earn. why we need shipping this course, while probably the cheap- est for the moment, disregards two fac- tors which have thus far governed our action in striving to build up a merchant marine: first. the question of defense. the years 1914 to 1919 conclusively proved that the control of a merchant fleet may be essential to the national defense; more, it will -be an absolute essential when- ever we have to maintain an overseas army. after our late experience no argu- ment is needed to show what might be our situation should we again be caught without an auxiliary merchant fleet. second. the question of future trade. ever since our civil war we have de- pended upon foreign tonnage to carry our exports and imports, because they could do it cheaper than we could do it. the most prosperous period of american seafaring came to a close shortly after the middle of the last century. for the change there were many contributing factors, but the main cause was the su- perseding of wooden hulls by steel and the displacement of sail power by steam. as long as the wooden hulls dominated the ocean and sail propulsion prevailed, our seaboard forests, mechanical ingenu- ity and our cheap production of cotton and naval stores sufficed to neutralize the lower wage levels of europe in the car- riage of ocean traffic. but with the ad- vent of iron and steel construction and the progressive displacement of sails by steam, these advantages disappeared and other pursuits offered higher rewards to both capital and labor on this side. there-. fore, from 1870 to 1914, american deep sea tonnage gradually ceased to be an im- portant factor in the carrying trade of the world. in the meantime, we had be- come one of the most important: export- ers of foodstuffs and raw materials. - before the great war broke out, how- ever, far-seeing statesmen perceived that a change in our economic situation was approaching and that our national policies 207 might have to be modified to meet new conditions. the last speech made by president mckinley evidenced a keen ap- preciation of the fact that in the not far distant future we should have to look to foreign trade to absorb the sur- plus products of our industry. this situation is now here. it has been approaching for many years. the great war was not the cause of it, but has certainly been the means of hasten- ing our recognition of it. our situation of 30 years ago was fully appreciated by our foreign competitors. the great maritime nations took no. ac- tion against american shipping because they did not fear it. they knew that we were not serious competitors for the carrying trade, and they knew why. they knew that foreign trade was merely * an adjunct and not the backbone of american industry. but to england, for instance, her ocean traffic and export business were absolutely vital, in order that her wide empire might be bound to- gether and her dense industrial popula- tion find employment. for this reason, and because she needed to import cheap foodstuffs and raw materials, her policy toward all the world, ourselves included, was liberal in matters of trade. competition for survival no thoughtful man can watch the ut- terances of foreign statesmen, the drift of foreign opinion, or the utterances of the foreign press without realizing that we are today regarded as serious com- petitors, upon the ocean and in foreign markets, and that the competition which we must meet will be a general survival of the fittest. hence we must expect and prepare for a change in the treatment which we have received from abroad in matters of foreign trade. our neighbors will not give up any part of their ex- port and freighting business until they have exhausted every weapon of defense at their command. in the struggle for carrying trade, and export markets, they will discriminate against us by every available method, from freight rates to protective tariffs. : under such circumstances we can not wisely plan our future course by the light of conditions which already have passed away. this, apart from the unanswerable ar- gument of national defense, is the strong- est point made by the advocates of an american merchant marine, and it is on these two considerations that they base their arguments. therefore, if the de- cision be to quit, that is, to dispose of the ships already built for what they will bring, it should be clearly understood that this would mean a return to our former maritime dependence, in peace and war, for a generation at least; for if the ships  * markets. or \u00e9 be sold without restriction as to flag, they will be operated under foreign flags, because it will be more economical to so operate than under the conditions made by american labor and american legisla- tion. should sales be unrestricted? to illustrate: the operating cost of a japanese ship today for wages and sub- sistence only is but little more than half the cost of operating an american ship of similar size and class. at the present level of norwegian exchange, cost of wages and subsistence on norwegian ves- sels will be about 40 per cent of ours. obviously, in a competition which will cut to the bone ships' that can operate, re- spectively, for 50 and 40 per cent of our wages and subsistence will have a great advantage. the cost of construction and repairs also is higher here than abroad, meaning, of course, a higher expense for maintenance, interest, depreciation, in- surance and repairs. for this reason the unrestricted sale of our ships will result in their promptly passing under foreign flags,-and our merchant marine will be back where it was in 1913. -- if, however, the ships are sold with the restriction that they must be operated under our flag (and therefore subject to existing american laws, as well as the higher expenses of operation under our flag), they must either be run at a loss for the. present or laid up. in -either case it will result that when the ships, through marine casualties, age or other causes, are lost or scrapped they will not be replaced under our flag. further, even among those ships which \"may be considered as possibly able to compete for traffic, there is a great dif- ference in value, efficiency and probable duration of service. to some of. the ships now running, and considered fairly good, experienced engineers give not more than five years of activity before the cost of maintenance will more than offset the profits of operation in normal such a condition marks the end of commercial service in any cargo ship. therefore, the life of our merchant marine, under economic conditions which will discourage continuous construction and operation, probably would be a short if. not a merry one. ae these are good grounds' for concluding that the sale of the fleet would mean the end of our experiment in establish- ing a permanent merchant marine... and if the experiment be now abandoned it is a safe guess that this generation will not see it repeated. if, on the other hand, it be decided that a merchant fleet must be maintained for reasons of national defense, and for protection and development of our for- marine review eign commerce, the question of method becomes vital. government operation, pure and simple, is unthinkable. if there were any question that the machinery of constitutional government js unfitted for the operation of commercial enter- 'prises, our recent experience in govern- ment management of railroads would pro- vide a complete answer. no such government operations can be -yndertaken under our form of govern- ment without the intrusion of . \"politics\" (of the kind usually put in quotations ) into the problem, and the intrusion of \"politics\" always involves the question of - patronage. dickens once remarked that much of english law was incomprehensible until one found the keynote, and that the key- note, as he stated, was to make business for lawyers. once this is realized, he said,. the whole system of english law becomes intelligent and coherent. chang- ing the application, it may be said that the working of \"politics\" under popular in- stitutions is impossible to understand un- less one realizes that one main purpose of \"politics\" is to provide jobs for poli- ticians.. it has been so from king nebu- chadnezzar to president wilson, and no other result can be expected until the public service is confined to supermen. now, in a business so keenly competitive as ship operation, no considerations can wisely influence the choice of personnel, except experience, ability and character. any other principle of selection is fatal to good results. why federal operation fails this, however, is not the chief argu- ment against government operation. weakening of the element of personal interest, diffusion. of authority and di- vision of responsibility are others. where authority is diluted, efficiency is sacri- ficed; where responsibility is divided, conscience is subdivided; for the stimulus of close, personal (and, if one please), selfish interests in results, there are no equivalents and only shabby, makeshift substitutes. as there appears no volume of public sentiment in favor of government opera- tion, pure and simple, that course may be dismissed with this. brief reference. an alternative course has thus far been pursued--that of operation by. pri- -.vate firms under. close and detailed gov- ernmental direction. of this it may be sufficient to say that, by common consent of all, from the indi- -vidual operators to the chairman of the shipping board, the results have not been satisfactory. such a method cannot be kept alto- gether free from \"politics;\" but beyond this the dilatory operation of cumbrous government machinery, in a worldwide may, 199, competition hourly involving prompt de. cision and quick action, is about as ef. fective as would have been the field com mand of the allied armies by a congres. sional committee. if, therefore, it jg de- cided to endeavor to maintain our mar- chant fleet, if to do so under private own- ership is at present impossible ; if, fur- ther, it cannot be effectively -- operated by government machinery, the indicated course is clearly toward the' utilization of private initiative and experience un- der government ownership, until present conditions shall improve. how this may be done will be considered in the next article.

'ihe albania, 12,000 tons, which will carry cabin passengers only, after making her maiden voyage in the liverpool-canada-new york service, returned direct to london and took her place in that service. the other ship, scyruhia, 21,000 tons, .a_ sister ship of the samaria, took her place in the cunard liverpool-canada-new york serv- ice, calling at queenstown. the tyrrrhbnia, 16,000 tons, is expected to take her place in the company's passenger service early next summer. the remaining vessels will take the water in the near future. they are the franconia, laconia, and _ smrvia, each 600

mersey-built vessel of the liner type to possess propelling machinery con- sisting of the very latest improved type of brown-curtis turbines driving twin- screws through double reduction mechan- ical gearing; and the largest liner to be designed and built on the mersey to burn oil fuel. her auxiliary machinery will be driven by the improved electro-hy- draulic system. she will also be fitted with

class and second class passengers. in the samaria, too, it will be found that a_ successful effort has been made to provide third. class passen- gers with every degree of comfort. for all classes of passengers the construction and design insures considerable space, both open and covered, for promenading, exercise and various games. the passenger accommodations of the samaria will extend over

and cargo spaces are placed at each hatch and electro-hydraulic variable speed gear winches are fitted throughout. the boat winches, capstan, windlass, warping winches and steering gear are all oper- ated on the electro-hydraulic principle. there is thus a complete absence of big steam pipes running fore and aft in the ship interfering with promenade and ac- commodation space. two large sets of

abroad. an instance of this is provided by the sending of the italian liner gutio ceasare from the northeast coast to genoa to complete the necessary wood- work. the joiners' strike has resulted in several other vessels being -- sent abroad. col. leslie wilson stated in the british house of commons. that more than 20 british ships had been sent to continental ports during the last few months to be refitted and re- conditioned, as the result of the join- ers' strike. it is impossible to give a reliable estimate of the amount lost in wages but direct loss in repairs alone varied from $20,000

by the change in the coal export quotations over a period of three months. in december, 1920 the f.o.b. export quotation was about $18.50; in january, 1921, about $13.50; and in february about $9.50. value is in the neighborhood of $8.00. faced by the large army of unem- ployed and very little money in the various unions, the miners realize they must fix up a temporary agreement, or, by allowing the notices to expire, throw themselves among the idle work- ers. the nationalization of the mines which so long has been a suggestion which found widespread support among the miners, is regarded as effectively killed by the present position of the in- dustry. * * * qo* the tyne, about 115 vessels with a net tonnage of 135,788, are laid up. so serious is the congestion in the river, that representations have been made to the shipping controller with a view to the removal from the the present marine review tyne of vessels belonging to the gov- ernment. to how great an extent ship- ping in the tyne has been affected is shown by the small number of vessels launched in february, the total being eight of an estimated registered ton- nage of 15,345. for the corresponding month of 1920, eight vessels of an es- timated registered tonnage of 38,279 also were launched. the total from jan. 1 to feb. 28 this year was 19 ves- sels of 43,399 tons compared with 11 vessels of 44,006 tons for the corres- ponding period of 1920. on the tees ail similar slackness prevails. the eee of vessels passing in and out of the tees during february totaled 212,- 824 tons, this being 22,937 tons less than in january. the number of ves- sels thus recorded was 193 for janu- ary and 194 for february. -looking hopefully to the future, however, the tees conservancy commission has in view a scheme to

manager of the pacific steamship co., seattle, is strongly opposed to sub- merging the shipping board and the merchant marine in the department of commerce or any other department. mr. haines has just returned to his office after spending a month in cali- fornia on business. he has given the subject considerable thought and study and as the admiral line operates more american vessels than any other cor- poration in the united states, it is vitally interested in any 'proposed change. mr. haines declares that the solution of the merchant marine problem lies entirely in correlating all federal de- partments supervising shipping under one responsible head. in taking this position he asserts that the retention of a shipping board such as now con- stituted is essential under the new de- partment advocated. in the trend of his argument he shows that american shipping is greatly handicapped by having to deal with many different gov- ernment departments. for instance, when an american ship enters or clears at or from an american port it must deal with at least three governmental bureaus--the health department, cus- toms and inspection service. he adds that foreign competitors would be more than pleased to have the ship- ping board and merchant marine sur- rounded with more red tape. instead, all bureaus dealing with shipping, he adds, now scattered through various departments, should be placed under a new department of marine. \"it am heartily in favor of a cabinet post creating a department or portfolio of marine and i advocate embracing in that department all the existing bu- reaus now assigned to various other cabinet officers,' he said. \"for in- stance, why should the local inspector of hulls and boilers, a most essential de- partment relative to shipping, and the customs service, also essential to ocean commerce, be entirely distinct and separate governmental functions? it is decidedly unreasonable and most em- phatically expensive. \"the department of commerce has nothing to do with the merchant~ma- rine problem. it is interested in de- veloping foreign trade. its business is. to strive to have cargo \u00a2arried at the cheapest foreign rate. if we want to use the american merchant marine merely as a delivery wagon and pay the deficit by levying more taxes on our people, then the plan to sink the shipping board and the marine prob- lem in the department of commerce is probably. all right. -but that is nor the purpose of the nation. the. mer- chant marine act provides that the government fleet shall pass ultimately into private ownership and under such ownership it must be operated to make money. it is absolutely inconsistent to submerge it in the commerce de- partment and then expect it to be- come a real merchant marine operating on a paying basis. it is true that we need a lot of changes, but instead of being in the direction of the depart- ment of commerce they are needed in the opposite direction. \"all the functions pertaining to ship- ping, now scattered through many cabinet portfolios, should be concen- trated in a department of marine. then asa maritime nation we would have a chance to get somewhere. it is my belief that the group which wants to submerge the shipping board in the department of commerce is the same group which opposed the iner- chant marine act. i refer to the crowd that is connected in one way or an- other with foreign shipping interests.\"  check slump in british shipping ) | | despite barrier of high costs and slack trade, recent developments show ae is near n the last article in this series (february issue) some account was given of the experience of the brit- ish shipping industry in 1920. the re- . view described the gradual downward movement of the industry from great prosperity to depression, and no en- - couragement was, or could be, given to any idea that a return to prosperous times was yet in sight. there is noth- ing mysterious about the shipping situ- ation, which is controlled by hard economic facts from which there is no escape. high freights were caused, mainly, by the ever reducing supply of tonnage during the years of war, and by an altogether abnormal movement of men, munitions of war, and commodities across the oceans. the demand for ships was greater than the supply. con- sequently, the unchangeable law of sup- ply and demand forced freights to a high level, or maintained them there, in - spite of earnest efforts by governments to control them. now, as the result of the plans feverishly laid during the war, the available supply of tonnage is greater by more than 10,000,000 tons than in the summer of 1914. at the same time, nations. have been seriously crippled economically or have been put completely out of action, as far as the immediate resumption of oversea com- merce is concerned in the years before the war, shipping companies were effective in creating or stimulating commerce. all the great by cuthbert maughan

indeed, and has been making only a very slow recovery.. the united states and other great coun- tries have had vast quantities of prod- ucts to sell, but have found their wares beyond the straightened means of europe to purchase. never can there have been such a contrast between ex- treme activity in the shipping and ship- building industries of a year or two ago and the present depression. trade has always run in cycles, the average length of the good and bad periods being a matter which has pro- vided economists with much -- study. those cycles held their sway in years of peace or

depression, if only be- cause conditions are so bad. in any case, pessimism could do little to bring about any improvement, while opti- mism could do much. we still seem to be in a period in which there js a wide breach between the costs at which commodities have been produced and the prices which buyers can now afford to pay. this discrepancy has been seen in shipbuilding, as in other industries. builders have completed new _ ships, only to find owners willing to part with them immediately at prices far below those which they paid for their construction. in some cases, buyers at almost any price have not been forth- coming, and ships have been taken straight from the builders' yard to protected waters where they can. be laid up. laying up of tonnage on a_large scale began some months ago, and now the total amoun+ of tonnage laid up in the united kingdom can not. fall far short of 2,500,000 tons. these are primarily the ordinary cargo steamers, and, secondly, the -

only a small fraction, of their space occupied. so far relief has only been had from the lower price of bunkker coals. as compared with \u00a37 15 shillings, to which the price of best steam' coal

ships is now under discussion between the representatives of the shipping companies and the men, a round table conference in london of the national maritime board having been adjourned from march 17 until april 22, following the classification of british ships which has been adopted in these articles, we find the mail and passenger liners in some ways less unfavorably affected by the present conditions than the other classes. that is because prac- tically nothing was done to replenish the fleets of these liners during the war, all efforts being concentrated on the construction of simple cargo carriers. marine review since the armistice very little progress has also been made in building ships of this type, because of the prodigious cost. one of the largest liners built since the war is the arundel castle, .of 19: 000 tons gross, which is now receiving her finishing touches from messrs, har- land & wolff at belfast, ireland, and is to make her maiden voyage to south arica in the mail service of the union castle co. on april 22. a sister ship, the winpsor castlr, was launched by the prince of wales at john brown & co.'s clydebank yard on march 9, and is ex- pected to be ready for service in the early autumn, progress is being made with the new ships for the canadian pacific ocean services ltd. there are three of these vessels now under construc- tion on similar lines ito that of the pres- ent \"m\" one-class, of which the melita, minnedosa, and metagama are already in service. new liners are also being built for the cunard and p. & o. com- panies. a few weeks ago, when the british government became seriously disturbed about unemployment, great efforts were made to fit a number of ships especially for the emigrant trade. this work was complicated by the idleness of the ship- joiners in this country and arrangements were made to send the ships to the con- tinent, and especially to antwerp. it soon became clear that there were dif- ficulties in the way of countries over- seas receiving many thousands of immi- grants within a short time, and it was thought better to spread the departures over a comparatively long period. in any case, it seems clear that the passenger liner companies, whose fleets are not yet back to prewar proportions will be busily employed for some time to come, trade routes slack cargo liner companies have felt very seriously the falling off in trade. this has been very general and has applied to practically every route. the north at- lantic trade has been one of the quietest of all. even before the war, there was comparatively little demland for space on the voyage from europe, and lately, of course, exports from the united states have been on a small scale. homewards from australia, traffic has been maintained in large volume, which has meant that the immense stocks of wool in the united kingdom have been still further increased. lately, a demand for large quantities of welsh coal for new zealand has been wel- come to the shipping companies which, but for this exceptional demiand, would have had to send out ships nearly empty. freight rates to india have lately been reduced by from about 5 to 10 shillings a ton, a result, mainly 213 of competition of foreign companies from continental ports. were the vol- ume of trade to expand and working costs to be lowered, a general reduc- tion in freight rates would, no doubt, be considered practicable, managers of cargo liners have been especially concerned about the very great amount of pilferage of cargo which is still proceeding at ports throughout the world. committees of merchants, shipping companies, and ma- rine underwriters have been sitting to examine all aspects of the problem, and have made various recommenda- tions. the merchants suggest that all traders should take particular care in the choice of the carriers, point- ing out that some carriers by land and sir owen philipps, g, c. mm... ge mep. who has been elected president of the cham- ber of shipping of the united kingdom. sir owen is chairman and managing director of the royal mail steam packet co. and the union- castle mail steamship co, and chairman of various associated steamship lines. water deliver their goods in much better condition than others. the shipping managers direct special attention to the importance of tallying cargo at every stage through which it passes, and particularly on immediate discharge from the ships, and they also make special recommenda- tions for the adequate guarding of docks and wharves. in the port of london, a special police force has been organized under the auspices of the port authority and the shipping companies, and is believed to have been effective during the several months of its. ex- istence in bringing about a reduction of the evil. marine underwriters have decided to insure goods against the risks of theft and pilferage up to only 75 per cent of the shipping cost. this to be taken as the prime cost plus the costs incidental  214 to shipping and insurance charges, and they have also resolved to require merchants to give notice, in the event of loss, within 10 days of the expiry -of the risk. this stipulation is re- quired in, order that the underwriters may have some opportunity of tracing the origin of the thefts and of taking preventative measures in future. unfortunately, there seems to have been a serious lowering of the standard of commercial morality during the past ' few years, and a great many claims have been presented which under- writers feel should be fully investigated. this has occurred not only in respect of merchandise, but also in the case of ships. as the result of board of trade inquiries, certain ships have been shown to have been thrown away, and in other cases the circumstances of loss have been of a suspicious character. cargo steamship owners, who are always the first to benefit from a rise in freights, have, as usual, been the first to feel the decline in the demand for space and the consequent heavy fall in freights. the autumn months, as was pointed out in the last article, did not bring about that recovery which was to be expected in the pre- war years when the great crops were ready for movement. there has been no stimulus to the demand for trans- port during the first quarter of this year. much was hoped from a substantial recovery of the british export coal trade, but high producing costs have been a deterrent. shipping companies have been much interested in re- ports of the success of united states' firms in securing coal contracts which, in: past years, have been held by british exporters. during the past few weeks there has been some _ increase in the demand for vessels to load grain, both at the north atlantic and gulf ports of the united states, but when the freight offered for the united kingdom declined from 8 shill- ings to about 6 shillings, 9 pence a quarter, british firms maintained that there was not sufficient in the rate to cover expenses. some companies are known to have declined the rate, and one of two others declared that they had accepted it in order to bring their vessels home to be laid up in port. chartering more active a good deal of steady chartering has gone on from time to time during the past few weeks of vessels to load grain in the river- plate. as com- pared with' the lowest rate touched during the previous quarter of 40 shillings per ton, the freight accepted has ranged lately from about 30 to marine review 35 shillings a ton. quite an active business has been done in tonnage to load grain in the ports of the river danube, the freights paid ranging from about 26 shillings to about 29 shillings per ton for united kingdom. less has been accepted for mediterranean ports. this chartering began in feb- ruary, which was an unusually early time for such fixtures. \"this. year, however, the winter was an unusually mild one, and owners were willing to take the risk of their vessels being stopped by ice. very little chartering of vessels for time has been done. a number of british steamers are understood to have been chartered in march at a rate of 7 shillings per ton deadweight per month, which compares with a rate of 10 shillings at the end of last year to which the quotation had fallen from 30 shillings at the beginning of 1920. some of these vessels are under- stood to have been secured in con- nection with american coal contracts. germany. is believed to have been in- quiring for st\u00e9amers on time charter, but after the rupture at the conference in london in march, she is understood to have discriminated against british owned vessels. selling german ships in the unsatisfactory conditions which have prevailed during the past three months, the distribution among british owners of the ex-enemy ton- nage allotted to britain under the terms of the peace treaty has involved dificult problems. the total number of vessels allotted to that country by the reparations commission, including passenger and cargo steamers, sailing ships, and trawlers, is 301. the work of disposing of these ships was intrusted to lord inchcape, who was very successful in disposing to british. firms the large number of standard cargo steamers built for gov- ernment account during the war. the sales of the ex-german steamers rep- resented a far more difficult matter. british standard steamers were offered when freights were still high. the ex- enemy ships came to market when freights had fallen heavily. the allotment of the vessels pro- ceeded fairly steadily, but toward the end of march, when bidding became very quiet, the question of the future of the ships was brought to a head. there were some who thought that bidding for the ships might be opened to all the world, including germany. this proposal was, however, contested in various quarters. it was admitted that germany, by reason of the de- pletion of her mercantile fleet, might be in a better position to bid for the may, 192) ships than other countries. pointed out that the higher the prices bid the better for the reparation ac. count of germany, and that to -allow the return of the ships to her solely on this question of price would pe an outrage on the principles of the peace treaty. it was decide german ship policy the question of the future of the ships was referred to the council of the chamber of shipping for opinion, and the council unanimously resolved that the ships should be sold to british nationals only, and that no re- sales should be permitted to foreign owners for a period of five years. at the .-end. of - march 18 (passenger steamers and 75 cargo steamers were being offered in this way. bids are to be received until april 15. there were also 22 ex-ememy ships offered british nationals, allies, and neutrals. feb. 25 was an important day for the chamber of shipping of the united kingdom. day, shipping manag the famous skinn\u00e9fs' hall in the city of london, and discussed the out- standing shipping problems of the day. the events included the election of sir owen philipps as president for the current year, and of sir frederick lewis as vice president. -- sir owen philipps is chief of the royal mail company, which is in april inaugurating a new _ passenger and cargo service between hamburg and new york, with calls at south- , ampton and cherbourg. sir frederick lewis is the head of the furness, withy line, which is well known in the, united states for its transatlantic services. in the evening the annual banquet of the chamber was held, at which were present the prince of wales, the american ambassador, the president of the board of trade, the speaker of the house of commons, and many men eminent in the professions and_ the business world. naturally, the speech- es in the afternoon and evening dealt with the present unfavorable factors. nevertheless, there was, especially im the presidential address, an undercur- rent of encouragement. it was urged that since the normal life of a vessel 1s only about 20 years, and little has been done to dispose of old ships during the past few years, there should, im the early future, be a good deal of work for the shipbreaking industry. there was general agreement that working costs of every description must be reduced, and that when these expenses have been lowered and trade again becomes healthy, there should be much work for the shipping industry.   repair work to aid shipyards reconditioning of vessels now idle will bring rush. of orders--costs are sharply reduced hipbuilding basic costs are s declining... practically all ship- yards have now put into effect a reduction of 10 per cent or more in wages. in manyginstances the same reduction has been spread to salaries. but where salaries have not individual- ly declined, the overhead has _ been materially reduced by eliminating posi- tions in the executive offices. the reductions in wages and salaries have been effected without too great a dis- turbance although the wage reductions were not put into practice without some trouble with labor. materials are cheaper, which is an- other important factor in the indus- try: plates today cost around 2720 cents, pittsburgh, while during march a year ago, plates were quoted as high as 4.00 cents, pittsburgh. steel prices were at their peak at this time last year, having reached a figure much higher than that prevailing during the period of the war or immediately after. in 1919, plates were quoted around 3.00 cents pittsburgh. the war price was 3.25 cents. despite these reductions, little new business has appeared in the market. some yards report starting work on miscellaneous small craft. limited construction of harbor boats and fer- ries is scheduled, but steamship com- panies are holding back awaiting the pronouncement of a definite maritime policy by the new administration at washington. the eastern shipbuilders are encouraged, however, as they are anticipating that their reduced costs, resulting in declining prices for new ships, ultimately will appeal to the steamship owner. . it. has been fore- casted that should the new scale not appeal to the shipowners another re- duction in wages will undoubtedly be made about august. labor costs cut shipyard wages are still much higher than wages in companion industries. notwithstanding the expected objec- tions of the unions, a reduced wage scale is to be expected with every decline in the volume of building. the bethlehem shipbuilding corp. last month laid off some 400 men at its harlan plant. other yards are similar- ly restricting their forces: hog. is- land is now in the hands of caretak-- ers. the ship repair yards of the new york district have reduced wages 10 per cent and put into effect a re- classification of the crafts. this effects a savine of from 2% to 5. per, cent. the repair yards in the boston dis- trict have also reduced wages. the ship calkers were reduced 8 cents an hour and promptly initiated a strike. ship construction during february -was the smallest since the war. ac- cording to the official records, only 19 seagoing vessels of 110,369 gross tons were officially numbered. includ- ing the nonseagoing vessels, a total of 121,404 gross tons. of shipping was built in that month, which was below even the past december record. the february construction was nearly one- half the january figure. the march record was not much better, although the yards are anticipating considerable repair work. repair work will increase from now on. the american bureau of shipping reports on march 1 .a total of 330 ships representing 1,434,246 gross tons were under construction, including 276 merchant craft of 998,834 gross tons contracted for private account. these figures vary from the totals issued by the commissioner of navigation who reports 227 steel vessels of 901,229 gross tons were building or under con- tract on march 1. the larger share of these contracts is held by the beth- lehem shipbuilding corp. merchant shipbuilding corp., new york ship- building corp., newport news ship- building & dry dock co. and federal shipbuilding' corp. on the pacific coast, the greater part of the con- tracts is held by the moore ship- building co., northwest bridge & iron co., and southwestern shipbuilding co. construction for the emergency fleet -corporation is less than one third of the total of the contracts held by american shipyards. despite the tremendous slump _ in shipbuilding, it is a notable fact that steel seagoing oil barge constructed by the doullut & williams shipbuilding co. 215   rs - colors, 216 the tonnage now building -or under 'contract for private account alone is nearly three times as great as the to- tal annual construction of the american shipyards prior to the war. this is a record not at all to be despised, for it shows the ability of the better established american yards to compete for the world's shipbuilding. during march, the keel of the last ship to be built for the account of the emer- gency fleet corporation was laid. this was in the yard of the northwest bridge & iron co. ~ with the ending of government work, american shipyards are aroused to the fact that they must make some desperate effort -today, no prohibition exists against the importation of foreign-built ships, except in the coastal trade. the amendment to the panama canal act of 1914 removing all restrictions on the bringing under the american flag of foreign ships still remains upon the statute books of the united states. t he 6500-ton motorship keennecott, suilt at tacoma, wash. by the todd dry dock & construction co. for the alaska steamship co. recently underwent her trial trip with flying 11 knots being done without effort. this vessel has been fully de- scribed by marine review. the keen- necott has been chartered for her mai- den voyage to carry a cargo of 2,000,- 000 feet of lumber from port blakely to san pedro. she is being handled by the thorndyke-trenholme co., se- attle, who are negotiating an offshore charter. wartows, lid, victoria, b. c, are making good progress in repairing the express liner princ--e rupert of the grand trunk pacific steamship co. the prince rupert was wrecked in swan- son bay, b. c., sept. 28, 1920 and lay submerged for many weeks. yarrows took the repair contract on a time limit of 115 days and it is announced that the ship will return to service early in may. a new steering system has been installed and a similar system will be placed on the prince grorcr, sister vessel, as soon as the prince rupert resumes the run between se- attle and prince rupert. unless new contracts are obtained in the meantime, it is expected that steel shipbuilding . at portland, oreg., and vancouver, wash., will be at an end by july 1. the northwest bridge & to obtain business.' - marine review this means that a foreign-built ship, intended for the overseas trade, may obtain american registry without re- gard to her age. and finally it means that american yards must compete with foreign yards if they intend to build any of the international merchant ships of the future. : the leaders in the american ship- building industry are of the opin- ion they will be able to meet foreign competition once conditions revert to normal. in the meantime, however, there must be a reversion to normal of foreign exchange, and a betterment in the ocean freighting business to demonstrate a requirement for new construction. but there is a slump in the shipping business as well as the shipbuilding field and managers are taking advantage of this opportunity to reduce their costs and make other economies. the slump in internation- al shipping has lessened the demand for fuel and, therefore, the tanker demand today is not so brisk as for- mee pacific - shipyarde by \u00ae. c: hill iron works, portland, is completing sev- eral tankers and similar work is ap- proaching an end at the plant of the g. m. standifer construction co., van- couver. according to report, the latter yard may take up railroad car building work. the site belongs to the port of vancouver and according to agree- ment when work is finished the property together with improvements reverts to the port. it is assumed that every effort will be made to keep this splen- didly equipped plant in operation. wooden ship builders on puget sound report a recent improvement in the out- look as there has developed a fairly ac- tive inquiry for small gas fishing and towing vessels. considerable smal] re- pair work is being done and_ indica- tions point to renewed construction ac- tivity at many yards which have been practically idle for more than a year. for service in the arctic, the auxili- ary schooner lapy kindersley was launched at vancouver, b. c. march 26 from the ways of the british col- umbia marine engineers & shipbuilders ltd. the vessel is 200 feet in length and of 635 tons gross. she is of par. ticularly staunch construction to with- stand the ice floes of the far north where she will be~ used in trading. she is owned by the hudson bay co. the grant smith co., portland, has been awarded a contract by the port may, 192; mecly. the threats to restrict _ im. migration are also discouraging the plans of different

shipyard at tacoma which built ferris type vessels for the govy- ernment. mr. titlow as mr. wright's at- torney asked for a fee of $20,000 al- leging that he obtained a settlement of $416,000. for the wright yards from the shipping board. mr. wright con- tended that mr. titlow had nothing to do with the settlement. among the witnesses was judge r. a. ballinger, formerly secretary of the interior, who testified that the fee asked was not excessive. mr. titlow, who is prom- inent in politics, was awarded $7000. mr. wright is former mayor of ta- coma. : on march 17, the steel steamer sxkir- misher, 8390 deadweight tons, was launched from the wallace shipyards. vancouver, b. c. the vessel was built for the canadian government and is the last large craft under construction at these yards. the canadian traveler, built by the harbor marine co., vancouver, b. c., has completed her trials and has started loading railway ties for her maiden yoyage to alexandria, egypt. christened by a boy scout, harold adams, the tanker swifrscout was launched on march 12 from the ways of the northwest bridge & iron works, portland: the boy scout idea was that of raymond desmond, cranford, n. jj.,

$3 to $7, as the increase will have material bearing on the future of yards on the canadian side. after completing the construction of a 15,000-ton wooden floating drydock, in five pontoon units for the public deck commission at portland, the ship- building firm of cornfoot & mcintosh will shortly be dissolved and its prop- erty disposed of at auction. this in- cludes the plant of the albina ma- chine & engine works which built sev- eral steel steamers for the government during the war. suit has been filed in the united states district court at san francisco by the australian -commonwealth to

receiver is asked pending the outcome of the ac- tion. the vessels involved are the bat- catta, -benowa, boopyalla and ba- binda, built by the patterson & mc- donald yards, seattle, and the cooicya, cethana, challambra and culburra, constructed by the sloan yards, olympia, wash. they were originally ordered for the australian government but were acquired by j. e. chilberg, seattle, who later turned them over to the comyn interests. recently they have been op- erated between british columbia and gulf yards 2g puget sound and west coast of south america. the federal court at seattle has re- opened the case of the sloan shipyards corp. against the emergency fleet cor- poration in which damages amounting to $3,500,000 were asked because of can- cellation of contracts. the court had previously dismissed the action but granted a motion to set aside this decision that an amended complaint may be filed. this action is supposed to be preliminary to an appeal to the supreme court. are active shipbuilding plants take up repair and small boat work etting back to peace business \u00a2, after the hurry and expansion in work and profits during the war has been a serious problem for the shipbuilding companies along the gulf coast, but at least three of them in new orleans have solved the problem. they are operating with full forces and have files well filled with orders. these companies have turned their yards into ship repair plants, and into works for constructing seagoing steel barges, steel deep sea tugs, and coasting steamers of shallow draft. other companies along the gulf coast which have not been able to make this change, or have not seen the wisdom of doing it, are hav- ing considerable difficulty in finding suf- ficient work to keep their employes to- gether. the first new orleans company to take up the construction of smaller craft was the johnson iron works, dry dock & ship repair co., which con- structed several 100-ton seagoing steel tugs for order of the government at its yard on the bayou st. john, and is now engaged in building steel barges for the mexican oil trade. this company also operates a drydock and ship repair plant on the algiers side of the river. the doullut & williams shipbuilding co. inc., which built a fleet of eight 9600-ton steel steamships for the ship- ping board, completely outfitting them at its plant on the inner harbor and navigation canal, launched the last of this fleet, the orpham, on march .19. four of the eight ships have been de- livered, complete, to the shipping board agents at new orleans, having been taken around over lakes ponchartrain and borgne and thence up the mis- sissippi to the louisiana port. the other four are being outfitted for early delivery. = while the last of these ships was on the ways, the doullut & williams company began construction of a num- ber of large steel seagoing barges for use in transporting oil on the panuco river and across the bar at its mouth, at tampico, mexico. two or three of these barges were launched by april 1 and more are on the ways. the doul- lut & williams company also is going into the construction of seagoing tugs, and coasting steamers, the jahncke interests, which operated \u00a9 a yard for the construction of wooden ships at madisonville, some 30 miles across lake ponchartrain, during the war, are investing approximately $1,000,- 000 in a large drydock and ship repair plant on the mississippi river within the city limits of new orleans. in ad- dition to drydocking and repair work, this plant also will construct tugs, barges and small steamers. ~the small boat construction field is being well cared for by the new orleans boat building co., in which a. duvic & sons are the largest owners, and which is building power work and pleasure boats and repairing those in service. the southern yacht club has started the organization of a co-operative boat repair and construction yard, to be located on the grounds of the club at west end, new orleans, to take care of the fleet of 300 or more power boats which fly the s. y. 'c. pennant. the oil tanker, tuxpanoil was launched recently from the south plant of the baltimore dry docks & ship build- ing co., baltimore. the sponsor was mrs. roe edwin wells, a niece of wil- liam h. todd, president of todd ship- yards corp. the tuxpanot is a 10,300 deadweight ton tanker; 430 feet in length, 59-foot beam; 33 feet 3 inches in depth; 2650 shaft horsepower; single screw; geared turbines; with a speed of 10 knots; equipped with three scotch boil- ers; oil burning; forced draft. she has a cargo capacity of 3,000,000 gallons.  218 _. marine exhibitors unite organized with a membership of 159 companies, the marine equipment manufacturers association was brought into 'being at a meeting held at the hotel mcalpin, new york, on march 28. the association, designed pri- marily to control the holding of marine expositions in the future, is intended to include not only all those manufacturing marine equipment, but shipbuilders, shipping companies, in- surance agents and those engaged in selling ship supplies, and naval stores. while recognizing the merit of join- ing in movements to advance the in- terests of -an americen merchant ma- rine, the association decided to. have as its main object the staging of marine shows upon a 'strictly co-op- erative basis and thus greatly reduce the cost to the exhibitors. os \"the affairs of the new association will be placed in the hands of an executive committee selected to rep- resent the various sections of the coun- \"ty. this committee is to be com- posed of 18 men, 6 of whom will serve for one year, 6 for two years and 6 for three years. all executive com-. mitteemen chosen later will be elected for a term of three years and be barred from re-election. permanent officers for the year 1921 were elected as fol- lows: . president, e. a. simmons, president, simmons-boardman ipub- lishing co., woolworth building, new york; vice president, w. h. todd, president, todd shipyards corp., 15 whitehall street, new york; and sec- retary treasurer, k. l. ames, jr. american steel foundries, mccormick building, chicago. : the executive committee elected and districts. from which chosen follow: new england district e. b. williams, manager marine. de- partment; b. f. sturtevant co., hyde park, boston. _ f. l. andrews, vice president, hyde windlass co., 2 federal street, : bath, me. . new york and new jersey district m. l. katzenstein, manager marine 'department, \"worthington pump & ma- chinery corp: 115 broadway, new on = ae w. m. mcfarland, manager marine department, babcock & wilcox co, 85 liberty street; new york. _h. c. davis, vice president, row & davis engineers, inc., 90 west street, new york. . frank hatch, vice president, shep- atd electric crane & hoist co., mon- \"tour sfalis. n.y. h.r. sutphen, vice president, sub- marine review marine boat corp., 11 pine\u00bb street, new york. pennsylvania, maryland, delaware, district of columbia, virginia and west virginia district g. w.. selby, secretary-treasurer, marine decking &-..supply co., 116 north delaware street, philadelphia. j. c. mcquiston, director of publicity, westinghouse electric & mfg. co.,. hast pittsburgh, pa. william stayton, president, baltimore steamship co., 662 lexington building, baltimore. w. p. smith, william cramp & sons ship & engine building co., 100 broadway, new york. south atlantic and gulf states district paul jahncke, of jahncke dry dock & shipbuilding co., new orleans. great lakes district, f. c. bradbury, manager marine de- partment, crane co., 836 south michi- gan avenue, chicago. j. d. sarles, manager marine depart- ment, pyle-national co., 30 .church street, new york. h. l. hibbard, manager marine de- partment, cutler-hammer mfg. co., 50 church 'street, new york. j. h. redhead, advertising manager national malleable castings co., 7706 platt avenue, cleveland. pacific coast district w. m. wampler, eastern manager, coen co., 50 church street, new york. h. f. atlexander, president, pacific steamship co., seattle. 'rename munson liner southern cross will be the name of the second new 21,000-ton displacement passenger ship which the munson steam- ship lines will place in the south amer- ican run. as originally planned, this ship was to be named sea girt, in honor of the state of new jersey, but the change of name was arranged as more befitting to the north and south run into which the ship is to be placed. the american lugion, a sister ship, has also been allo- cated to the munson line by the shipping board for the south american services. these two vessels will be operated in conjunction with the marrya wasu- ington, huron and arotus. the port strike is at present delaying the martha wasutincton at buenos aires. in view of 'this trouble, it is probable that the caltao will once again be withdrawn from her anchorage at hog island and placed in tthe south american run temporarily. the munson steamship lines are scheduling a' sail- ing every two weeks with this fleet. \"men's ee : may, 192) amendments to seamen - act proposed lake interests opposed to the l follette seamen's act met at detiit april 8-9 and adopted a plan of action to secure the modification of restric- tive provisions of this law, represen- tatives were present from a large nunm- ber of lake cities and included ves- selmen as well as delegates from chambers of commerce and generaj business industries. ' ss proposed amendments to the gea- act, which have been found particularly inimical to lake vessels, were submitted and approved. the thread of the discourse showed a con- viction that the seamen's act as ap- plied to the great lakes is \"strangling industry in the middle west and threat. ening to drive the lake carriers out of business.\" among the chief objections raised is to the provision compelling lake shipowners to maintain watches cn vessels while they are tied up in port, and placing an excessive number of life boats on lake ships, which, ex- perience has shown, take up so much room that the number of passengers must be reduced. the charcoal iron co. of america, detroit, forwarded~'a_ letter 'which showed that this firm under the terms of the seamen's act had found it heces- sary to employ three coal passers on its vessel although none of the men had performed any work whatever since 1915, because coal was fed auto- matically on the vessel. at the closing session, the proposed amendments were submitted and ap- proved. this draft will be submitted to congress and active support of the amendments will be given by the ma- jority of the lake interests. opposi- tion to the law has taken concrete form in recent months as a result of the decision of several passenger lines to discontinue services which the act has made continuously unprofitable for sev- eral years. capt. john g. crowley, brookline, mass., died recently at 65 years of age. captain crowley organized the coast- wise - transportation co. some 20 years ago for transporting coal from hampton roads to boston and other points in new england. he built the 7-mast schooner thomas w. lawson, largest of the type, and the grorce w.: wells, first 6-master, as well as other vessels for coastwise service. patterson, wylde & co. resumed their former boston-manchester service, with the sailing of the shipping board steamer datlas on april 5.   may, 1921 service to india reference made to the placing of the steamer city of maarsseilles in the service between new york and indian ports, via the suez -canal, by the american & indian line in the march, 1921, issue of marine review may have given the impression that this is a new service. the line has operated a passenger service over this run since april, 1916, commencing with the steam. . er city of manchester. the crty or marseilles was built for the eller- big yacht launched at he steam yacht delphine was launched -at the river rouge, mich. yard of the great lakes engineering works on april 2. she has the. greatest \u00b0known torfnage in yacht construction, being 250 feet on the water line, 258 feet over all with 35 feet 6 inches beam and 14 feet 8 inches draft. she displaces 1700 tons. her unusually. large .oil fuel\u00bb capacity gives her a cruising radius' of ahovt 7000 knots. she was designed by h. j. gielow, new york, for, the - late horace e.- dodge, detroit. the big yacht has five decks, orlop, lower, main, saloon and boat or upper deck. the orlop deck is given up al- most entirely to storage. on the lower deck forward, the forecastle has 24 berths for crew. immediately aft- are the principal quarters for the _ ship's officers, including staterooms, \u00a9 bath rooms, \"lavatories. and a large. mess dodge yacht?

cylin- drical grinding is em- ployed extensively to expedite the production arine engine building is a branch of the machinists' trade -calling for: a high ao gree of skill that is developed only through many years of practical ex- perience. men employed in' engine building, taken as a class, show a gratifying interest in their work. they realize that if the parts of a marine engine are not properly con- structed disaster at sea may result, for if the engine fails to function properly when the ship is running through a heavy seaway, the life of every man aboard is at stake. this is true especially of l-engine vessels. executives of the busch-sulzer bros ---diesel engine co., st. louis, realizing these facts, many years ago began to build an efficient shop organization 30 that defects in workmanship would be- come almost unknown. rigid inspec- tion of every part takes place both dur- ing and after machining operations, in order to make the finished product as near perfect as possible. the main machine shop is modern in all respects. it is. provided with ample natural lighting facilities, which eliminate practically the :neces- sity of artificial lighting, ex- cept during the winter months. the machine tool equipment ts up to date and so arranged that plenty of floor space is provided. thus a large number of engines can be in process of construction at -one time. heavy machining is done on_ the main floor, while lighter machining operations and the assembling of cotn- paratively light units is carried on in a large central gallery extending the entire length of the shop. the ob- ject of this article is to describe brief- ly several of the nore important or seagoing vessels-i] by fred b. jacobs machining operations. the meth- ods followed on diesel: engine work, comipared with those in use in building steam engines, differ greatly in one respect. on diesel engine work, grinding wheels and grinding machin- ery ate relied on to insure accuracy and to expedite production. on _ reg- ular work on marine steam engines the use of abrasive wheels for finish- ing operations is almost unknown. bed plate made the bed plate is made in sections, as this practice insures a complete unit free from excessive internal strains. the first machining operation on the bed plate is to rough plane the sev- eral sections. the ends that are to form the joints then are carefully roughed and finished. the necessary bolt holes next are drilled and reamed in sections fig, 1\u00a7--gears are carefully tested with micrometers 221 engines are given a. thorough running test after assembling to make sure that they function properly and develop rated power the and sections fastened together. the assembled bed plate then is fin- ish planed on the bottom, after which the seats for the main bearing caps are carefully finished. stud holes for the bearing caps next are drilled and tapped, the studs put in place and the bearing caps assembled. these have been previously planed to a good fit. liners are interposed between the caps and bed plate for the purpose of mak- ing adjustments as wear develops. the next operation is to bore out the seats for the main bearing shells. this is an exacting operation, for, if they do not align properly, the jour- nals are sure to heat: unduly. fig. 33 shows the base' plate in place for bor- ing. for this work a massive hori- zontal boring mill is used. the bed iplate rests on a cast iron floor-plate provided with a number of t-slots to expedite strapping the work in place. as shown, the bed plate rests on par- allel blocks and is securely strapped in place by means of u-straps, hard wood blocking be- ing placed at the rear end of the strap. four straps, two on a side, hold the bed down, while four shore jacks, two on each side, keep the set-_ ting accurately in line during the boring operation. in setting the bed plate in place, care is exercised to make sure it sets level with the floor plate. this is readily determined with a_ surface gage. the bed plate is aligned hcrizontally by tak-  marine review fig. 16--sides of piston rings*are accurately finished by grinding ing micrometer measurements _ be- tween the boring bar and the ver- tical planed surfaces that locate the . bearing caps. with the bed plate properly aligned, the caps are securely bolted in place with liners under them and the bor- ing operation begun. in fig. 33 it is shown that an outboard bearing is provided for the end of the boring bar, while another intermediate sup- port is located between the second and third bearings from the right. three to four chips are necessary to finish the holes accurately, after which fac- ing tools are set in the bar and the ends of the bearings carefully faced. it is necessary to face the ends ac- curately as they bear on the flanges of the main bearing shells. thickness of the bearings is determined with micrometer calipers. the bores also are finished with extreme accuracy. this insures interchangeability of parts. bores scraped to a bearing as stated, the bored holes in the bed plate accommodate the main bear- ing shells. to make sure that the sh\u00e9lls will fit snugly and withstand the strain of continuous' operation without working loose, the bored holes are carefully scraped to fit an align- ing bar. this bar is accurately fin- ished by grinding. scraping these holes may seem an unnecessary oper- ation; but it must be borne in mind a hole finished by machining methods presents innumerable high spots. these high spots would break down under the continual thrust of opera- tion and cause a \"sloppy\" fit with the bearing shell. serious to -a on which no main loose iron this would soon bearing pound. scraping leaves a dead smooth surface it is

'sides of the crank webs, the flat surfaces on the webs then are planed. the section next is mounted on offsets and the crank pin roughed and finish turned and the inside of the webs faced. the offsets used in locating the shaft section are accu- rately made so that parallelism he- tween the pins and main journals is assured. this is necessary, as other- wise the crank pin boxes could not be set up properly which 'would fe- sult in a crank-pin pound after the engine had been in use a short while. the next operation 1s to daly ang ream the flange holes, after which the shaft is assembled. it is then mounted in a lathe between centers, the main journals carefully finished and the ends'faced. as all the jour- nals are finished at one operation, it is obvious they will be concentric with

paratively few machining operations on the crankcase aside from those mentioned. the machining must be done carefully, however, as this unit must be both oil and gas tight. cylinders are made in two parts, an outer jacket that is rigidly bolted to the crankcase and a liner that forms the running barrel. the object of this construction is to save expense in case: of repairs. it is a much more simple and inexpensive procedure to draw an old liner and substitute a new one than to rebore a_ cylinder. aise ' the cylinders proper are bored on ee ee eae vertical boring mills. the object of , using a vertical boring mill is to ma- chine the cylinder in the same _ posi- tion it assumes in the assembled en- gine. the first operation is to rough bore the cylinder bore and counter- sink depression at the top that ac- commodates the flange on the liner. then the cylinder is turned over and me the bottom faced. next it is care- 8 ee fully finish bored to an exact fit for - the liner.

the shipping board steamer absecom has been placed out of commission at the port of boston.  world charter marketreviewed by tradeimproves revival of business at different - ports brings upturn in shipping --some idle tonnage set to work mprovement in the ocean shipping field is near. a change from the expensive slump has set in and a better understanding is being effected - between rival interests. american shipping has been awaiting impatiently the appointment of a new shipping board and the definition of the mart- time policies of the new administration. the hope _ is entertained in many quarters that ultimately the government will resort to a system of subsidies and an. abolition of government ownership. primarily for this reason many of the private companies are holding on a little longer. in the meantime, peace has been made in the very expensive rate war in the french atlantic and rates on those runs have been materially advanced. attention is necessarily drawn to the abnormal amount of idle tonnage. but idle tonnage is not exclusive to the united states. one financial sur- vey reports that 822 american vessels, including 286 wood ships, dre tied up. this means that more than 30 per cent of the shipping board vessels are idle. british vessels are tied up in equal proportion, but in the case of the norwegian tonnage the situa- tion appears to be even worse. <a total of 300 nor- wegian ships are idle, according to report, represent- ing some 700,000 tons. but during march, the shipping board issued orders to withdraw 8 ships, representing some 82,000 deadweight tons, from tie-up and assigned them to operating companies. this fact alone would seem to indicate the turning of the tide.in the american market. \u00a9 in the meantime, steamship operators have en- deavored to follow the lead of other nationals in reducing wages. a wage reduction of 20 per cent on new york towboats has precipitated a strike. nevertheless it 1s now proposed to put in effect on may 1 a reduction of 1214 per cent in wages aboard ship. both atlantic and pacific coast steamship companies will join in this movement and_ the _ shipping board has signified its willingness to abide by the result. | the shipping board has deter- mined to remove a few more op- unite to erators from its lists. the assump- desmote tion is that government vessels are u s74 to be allotted where greatest effi- os ade ciency can be obtained. a further concentration of the management of the vessels will make for more effecting handling. in addition, the shipping board has opened a freight soliciting office in st. louis. this is largely an experiment, yet tis hoped to result in diverting more cargoes to american ves- sels. if the scheme proves successful the plan will very naturally be extended. in co-operation with dispatched her to hamburg. the department of commerce, the shipping board weal make another survey of trade routes, an evi- dent intent exists to co-ordinate all the interests involved under the american flag to fight for the shipping business. april marked a _ historical de- velopment in the french atlantic trade. at last the french and belgian lines agreed to attend the trade conference and signed a new schedule of rates. that marked the end of the rate war which was precipitated. nearly a year ago and which has been very destructive to the steamship companies mm these itis. coal to harve last year brought $20, but due to the rate war this was reduced to $4. as the result of effecting peace, freneh ay lantic rates have been increased in some instances as much as 300 per cent. while it would appear that these increases are abnormal, they are still regarded as not in a safe proportion to the cost of doing business. american coastal vessels have effected a through arrangement with transpacific lines, making it now possible to ship direct from the atlantic coast to the orient on a_ through-bill-of-lading, transshipment being effected at pacific coast ports. the williams steamship co. has announced a number of reduc- tions in the intercoastal rates. owing to the pro- hibitive transcontinental rail rates, california fruit is now coming to the east via the coastal lines. hird-class business is at pres- ent the most appealing to steam- dione of ship companies despite the fact a that the united states is expected : to enact legislation to restrict im- lines migration. the american line has reconditioned the freighter mun- nekadha into a third-class boat and the red stay ge has placed the samianp, another exclusively third- class boat, in the philadelphia and antwerp service. the kerr steamship co. has inaugurated a reg- ular freight service from hamburg to the river plate, which

'they -are within the next eight or ten -weeks. there has been a little chartering in the market during the past month, but this as a whole has been negligible. the river plate recently started with a burst. of activity. within a few days, some 14 or 15 steamers of handy size were placed. values kept up fairly well. in this trade, much depends upon the grain purchases by europe. grain has been moving out of galveston and one or two other gulf ports in great quantities. greek and italian orders have appeared at new york. shipments also have been made through portland, me. the tie-up of ships all over the world has ma- terially affected the fuel business. despite labor troubles in english coal fields, nothing of conse- quence resulted in the demand on this side of the atlantic. fuel oil has likewise decreased in price and demand. the shipping board has tied up the tanker selma. the demand for coal and oi is, necessarily, predicated upon the activity of shipping \u00b0 and the requirements of bunker stations. while the general tendency of the charter market on the north pacific see signs has been downward during march, cae strengthening of ocean freights in or oming two directions within the closing upturn week indicates that possibly the long expected upturn has come. this sudden firmness may not prove per- manent but operators believe it is the first ray of light following a long period of darkness and un- certainty. after a month of a $10 rate on lumber to the orient, the conference lines have succeeded in rais- ing this item to $15 per thousand feet. the $10 level was granted under protest and considerable cargo was booked at this low rate which was only ~ $1 higher than the prewar level: when operating costs were much less. by concerted effort, the trans-  232 believe is warranted by improved conditions and which - will allow them to make a slight profit. american 'carriers, it was asserted could not handle lumber at $10. ; the rate on wheat and flour carriers from north pacific to great britain and mediterranean ports has just advanced from $10.50 to $12. a norwegian steamer' was recently fixed at the lower rate but a slight flurry in the market sent the rate up to $12 at which figure three shipping board steamers have just been taken. the previous government rate was $15. the tonnage in question has been idle for some time and the rate of $12 was accepted rather than have the business go to foreign vessels. whether the market will remain at $12 is- an open question as there is no great demand for vessels in this trade. e following a reduction in the steel rate.to the orient from $11.25 to readjust $6.50, a further readjustment has re- ee sulted in a rate of $5.88 per ton on iron and steel products. the agree- rates ment was reached following an im- portant meeting of the -westbound pacific conference. because of re- ductions in the all-water route from atlantic ports to the far east, pacific operators were confronted with the necessity of cutting their schedules to meet competition from eastern ports. the new tariff is said to place pacific ports on a parity and now it is expected that considerable steel and iron will be di- verted to the combined rail and water route through pacific gateways. in addition to the cut on steel, through rates to the orient are now $15 on unmanufactured tobacco while cigarets take a rate of $10 per net ton. automobiles have been cut from $10 to $8 per measurement ton. with these readjustments, pacific services expect that they will now get their share of through business which for the last six months has been moving through atlantic ports which were favored by the rates in existence until recently. while the reduc- tions have been drastic, pacific lines concluded thai material concessions must be made as a matter of self-preservation. in an effort to assist pacific coast packers to move their surplus stocks, the intercoastal lines have adopted new schedules under which canned goods are cut from 65 cents to 50 cents per hundredweight. this reduction is about 23 per cent. and applies to canned fruit, canned milk and canned salmon. the conces- sion is expected to stimulate the movement of these pacific coast products to eastern markets, the low- er rate is effective until july-31 next by which date it is believed the surplus on the west coast will have been cleaned up. while the lumber rate to the atlantic remains at $20 and ties at $18, lumbermen and steamship op- erators are in negotiation looking toward further concessions. lumber shippers are asking the water carriers to allow a .rate of $18 and also to give free carriage to stakes and straps used in the back. haul by rail. shingle shippers also want the steam- ships to assume the same liability allowed by the railroads. these matters are under consideration with evidence that an amicable agreement will be reached. while some water carriers do not like to handle lumber, the position of the lumber industry marine pacific lines are now back to a basis which they review may, 1921 is realized by the steamship operators and the lat. ter desire as far as is consistent to aid the lumber industry. however, the intercoastal lines are bookin increased tonnages of shingles, copper, canned goods flour and grain and a substantial business js being fostered. water shipments are rapidly in. creasing because of the high rail take trade tates. in fact the land carriers are bon considerably alarmed at the diver- : sion of cargo to the water routes, to railroads consider the situation the transcon- tinental railroads are to hold shortly a conference at san francisco for the purpose of working out a tariff of terminal rates based on water competition. the interstate com- merce commission will be asked to grant the nec- essary permission so that the roads may return to the prewar practice of meeting water rates. the railroads regard the situation as serious and they realize that some concessions must be made in order to meet the condition. prior to the war terminal rates were in effect based on panama competition. the steamships are conceded to be making serious inroads on the business of the land carriers. the movement of lumber in the offshore trades is very slow. little chartering has been done. the disparity -in exchange, the inability of foreign mar- kets to finance their needs and the hope of foreign buyers that commodity prices and ocean freights may go lower are deterrent factors. indicating the trend of the market, a sailing vessel has been fixed for lumber to the west coast at $20 per thousand while tonnage is said to be offering to australia at $18. the lumber rate to south africa is now $35, to united kingdom 200 shillings and ties at 150 shill--- ings. however, no lumber or ties are being booked and the market is dormant. the most active move- ment by water at present is in the intercoastal routes on which increasing business is noted although com- petition is very keen. -there is a slight improve- ment in the orient trades but the supply of space still exceeds the demand. a cut of $5 per ton in general freight from british columbia ports to calcutta is announced by the canadian merchant marine ltd., the new tariff of $14.40 corresponding to the rate from vancouver to hongkong and transshipment to calcutta. general cargo movement throush the port of boston has just about trade held its own during the past month, gaining put grain shipments have notice- ae ably increased and the whole sentt- at boston ment has improved

clearances at new york showed a marked im- provement during march, the record being the best for this year, better than for any month last spring and equal to the traffic through the port during last summer. of the 455 ships which entered the port in march, only 64 came in ballast. of the total,. 121 ships brought bulk cargoes and 270 carried general cargoes. of the 448 ships which cleared during march, oniy 56 went out in ballast. while the traffic is undeniably much heavier, it does not reach the volume which was being handled in the last half of 1920. at the same time, the tonnage supply is much larger than the demand and this is keeping rates down to the minimum. during feb- ruary, 50 more ships. entered than cleared. during march, the entrances exceeded the clearances by but 7 ships. this is an indication of the beginning of the end of the tie-up movement. phi dolphia tiathie traffic through the port of philadel- phia during march showed another gain, the improvement being especially notice- able in clearances. during february the number of ships clearing was 29 short of the number entering. during march the clearances were but 15 ships short of the entrances. a few bulk sugar cargoes have been brought in, while the exports showed little variation from the usual commodities. out of the total entrances, 19 ships en- tered in ballast, whereas 25 cleared in ballast. this indicates that the inward movement was heavier than the outward. american vessels predominated in the ballast movements both ways. month  rs om oe re cree tt mt te ee see -- marine news in a

and these did not al- ways give the time with a maximum exactitude. in ports where no time balls were maintained, the second of- ficer with a stop watch hied to the tele- phone to get the standard time. and to induce the \"hello\" girl to give the time to a second required diplomacy and patience.. in far ports, where time. was of no particular object to the natives, | the only way to determine it was by means of lunars. these required special conditions in regard to the juxtaposition of the heavenly bodies, as well as oi the weather, three sextant observations by two or. preferably three expert ob- servers, and an intricate series of calcu- lations. ; today, the wireless has solved the problems of time at sea. chronometers have not been superseded, but with wire- less and a good watch, the navigator has no need to worry over the possible errors of his chronometer rating. every hour the wireless signals the greenwich, or first meridian, time and, with an ordinary watch, the navigator easily can determine the error of his chronometer or whatever timepiece he uses, when taking sights for longitude. undoubt- edly, wireless has in this connection con- tributed an important aid to navigation, one which has lifted a burden of worry from the shoulder of the master and his navigating officers. in the development of directional wire- less, we have another important aid to navigation. most wireless stations at strategic points now are equipped with apparatus enabling them to tell the bear- ing of the starting point of wireless waves sent out by ships having proper appliances. direction finders are a comparatively recent development of wireless, and have not yet attained a satisfactory degree oi accuracy; but they probably will be im- proved. instruments generally employed now have a range of 300 miles. accord- ing to the british admiralty notice to mariners no. 952, 1920, a shore station, with practiced operators and_ instru- ments in good adjustment, should be 'able to give a bearing during the day, 'the maximum error of which should not -exceed two degrees. but it should be noted that at night errors may be larger, although sufficient data on this point are not yet available. it is obviously easier to check the accuracy of a wireless bear- ing by day than by night. when a navigator seeks to fix his ship's position by means of wireless bearings, the procedure is similar to that employed in fixing his position by means of bearings of visible objects. if the distance of the wireless station is not more than 60 miles, the bearing may be plotted on a mercator's chart as given, and the position shown will be approximate enough for practical pur- poses. but if the distance of the station exceeds 60 miles, allowance has to be made for curvature of the earth, or there will be an error increasing with the distance. as the course of a wireless wave fol- lows the track of a great circle, it will be represented by a curve, when plotted on a chart on mercator's projection, a curve which is concave towards the equator. it will show the greatest con- cavity, when it runs east and west and flatten out as the bearing changes to-- wards north and south. except when the bearing of a wireless wave is north or south--that is on a meridian--it cuts ship method of correcting bearings given by wireless 243  244 the meridians shown on a mercator's projection at a slightly varying angle it is this angle that has to be allowed for in plotting bearings directly on such a chart. gnomic charts now are pub- lished on which a great circle track 1s represented by a straight line; but these are not in general use. assume the cape race wireless sta- tion is located in latitude 52 degrees, 00 minutes, north, and longitude 50 de- grees, 00 minutes, west, a ship, whose po- sition by dead reckoning is latitude 48 degrees 00 minutes, north, and longitude 38 degrees 00 minutes, west, is given her wireless bearing from the station--what it is, is immaterial for the purpose of this illustration and i have neither charts nor nautical tables at hand. the prob-~ lem is to find the correction to this bearing, so that the navigator may lay his protractor or parallel rulers on the wireless station and determine his line of position. to find this correction the british admiralty gives the following formula: correction (in minutes) = (% differ- ence in longitude) x sine (middle lati- tude). it may be notcd that some merchant captains use the sine of the latitude on the station, instead of the middle lati- tude between the ship and the station, and claim that their formula gives re- sults of greater accuracy than that of the british admiralty. in the above example the middle lati- tude between the position of the wire- less station and the dead reckoning of the ship would be 50 degrees 00 min- utes, and the difference of longitude would be 12 degrees. thus, corrections (in minutes) --% x 12-deg. x sin. 50 deg. =360 deg. x sin. 50 deg. =275.8 min. =4 deg. 35.8 min.' this can be worked out also by the traverse table, taking the difference in longitude as distance, the latitude as course, then the departure will be the 'correction. having the correction of 4 degrees 35.8 minutes the problem now is to determine how it will be applied to the bearing given by the wireless station. a great circle represented on a mer- cator's chart being a curve concave to the equator, a wireless bearing taken from a station in the northern hemis- phere should be corrected as to make it more southerly before being plotted on the chart. suppose, cape race had informed the ship that her wireless bearing was south 60 degrees 0 minutes east. then the bearing or rhumb line to be laid off from cape race on a mercator's chart would have been south 60 degrees 0 minutes, east, minus 4 de- marine review . t * \"27\/7 grees, 36 ininutes, or say, south 551% degrees east. 'this bearing, plotted on mercator's projection, would give a line of po- sition which for short distances on either side of the dead reckoning, may be taken as representing the arc of a great circle, on which the ship is located. if a wireless bearing can be obtained from another station and another line of po- sition laid off, the intersection of the two fixes the position of the ship in the same way that cross bearings of visible objects do, though it is subject in a far greater degree to errors. it is, however, a very difficult matte: to plot long distance bearings on @ chart. if you do not believe this take protractors or parallel rulers and try it on a larger chart. various methods of plotting great circles on a mercator's chart are available, and it is possible to plot a wireless bearing in the same way, but the results are likely to be dis- appointing. the best plan in dealing with wireless bearings is to figure out the position, where the great circle cuts the dead reckoning latitude or longitude, and start from this, as a basis of the chart work. this can be done by mercator's sailing, either by computation or inter- polation of the traverse tables, which generally are worked out to distances 9i six hundred miles. take the wireless bearing as a course and, with either the difference of latitude or longitude be- tween the position of the wireless sta- tion and the dead reckoning position of the ship, it is an easy matter to find the other element you want. if you have not been able by recent observation to determine one or the other element in may, 192) the dead reckoning position, an adapt tion of the sumner method can be os ployed to advantage. with the wireless bearing as a course, calculate the lati. tudes for assumed longitudes 30 minutzs or one degree on each side of the deat reckoning longitude, plot these positions on the chart, and draw a line through all the methods of fixing a ship's ne: sition not as valuable, perhaps, as 4 sumner line of position marked out from the sun, but useful to the extent the wireless bearing can be depended on. all the methods of fixing a ship's po sition by bearings of visible objects car be employed in the case of wireless bearings. as the ship proceeds, she cay receive additional bearings and these worked out and plotted on the chart, with the course and distance and run between them, will enable the navigator tu determine his position with a pre- cision only dependent upon the accuracy oi the wireless bearings. where the ship is in soundings, a line of po- sition given by a_ wireless pearing may be- of first importance, but con- fidence in fixes determined by di- rectional wireless should never lead the navigator to neglect the lead. probably more ships 'shave come to grief from failure to make use of the lead than from any other single case. finishing propellers with a brasives abrasives play an important part in the manufacture of marine equip- ment as \u00a9 they. furnish <a

drottning- holm machined without employing special equipment. such an instance is shown in the accompanying illustration where the operation consists of finishing th> blades of a bronze propeller. the blades should be smooth; otherwise the entire energy available is not utilized in driving the vessel through the water. rough blades drag to a certain extent, that is, they carry an abnormal amount of water with them as they revolve. on the other hand, a propeller with smooth blades operates at high efficiency as the maximum amount of energy 1s utilized in propelling the vessel. in this instance, an excess amount of dead water is not rotated by the propeller. the device shown in the accompany- ing illustration is a flexible shaft grinde- made by the stow mfg. co., inc., bing- hamton, n. y. the device is driven by an electric motor mounted on the end of an arm while a pedestal supports the unit on a substantial base that is readily moved from place to place. power 13 transmitted by a flat leather belt to a 'pulley at the end of the arm while 2 flexible shaft transmits power from the pulley to the grinding wheel arbor. in this case the abrasive medium used is a setup polishing wheel. with the pro- peller in position as shown, the operator can face one side of all three blades. then by turning the propeller over, the other side is finished. another advantage in favor of polished propellers is that they do not become foul under ordinary conditions as the smooth surface does not afford a good hold for marine growths. the operation illustrated is one of many where \u00ab flexible shaft grinder can be utilized to advantage in grinding polishing parts that are unwieldy. and marine review drydock big ship unusual drydocking plans were neces- sary when the triple-screw, swedish- american liner drorrnringholm was raised recently in the 30,000-ton floating drydock of the morse dry dock & repair co., brooklyn, n. y. this ship was never before raised on this side of the atlantic as her deep draft and peculiar build, offered unusual difficulties. some doubt was felt of the ability to raise the drorr- ningholm on a drydock of the floating big swedish liner being type, but the vessel was warped in over the sunken platform, carefully blocked up, and within 35 minutes after the pumps were started, she was high and dry. the drotrningholm is built on the ocean greyhound type with the least possible bulk under water. her wedge- like shape and towering height furnished a sharp test of drydocking facilities. before becoming: the property of the swedish-american line, the drotrrniing- was the english ship vircin1an the allan line. during the holm owned by towed to her pier the morse plant 245 war she was put in service as a trans- port and auxiliary cruiser. while in this service she was torpedoed and sunk off the irish coast in 1918. after the war, she was raised and in april of last year was taken over by the swedish- american line. she has been completely reconditioned and refitted throughout with every facility for the pleasure and comfort of her passengers. an unusual feature is that she has no. steerage, and instead all third-class passengers are accommodated in cabins for two to six persons. her after drydocking at regular run is now between goteborg, sweden, and new york, the drorrningholm is 514 feet long, 60 feet beam, 11,000 tons deadweight, carries 1500 passengers and draws 31 feet of water. she has a speed of about 17 knots. the british steamer canadian pros- pector of the canadian merchant ma- rine, ltd., recently

company's new york agency. this unit will accommodate work 24 inches long and 10 inches wide. the grinding wheel head is mounted on a substantial swinging arm, the base of which comprises two trunnions, each carried by a broad journal on a shal- low box-section bed. the arm is free to oscillate in its bearings, being actuated by a connecting rod which is operated 'by a crank on a 3-speed gear box. by adjusting the crank throw, the oscillating stroke, at a radius represented by the center of the grinding wheel, can be varied from 0 to 24 inches. . ~ the grinding wheel head consists of a 16-inch, 8-segment cup wheel mounted on a ball-bearing spindle which is car- - ried on a ram haying an adjustment parallel with the axis of oscillation. of the swinging arm. this adjustment feeds the wheel to the work. it is con- trolled by a hand wheel on the gear box and can be operated when the arm is in motion. the wheel segments are 6 inches long and they can be used until they are reduced to 14 inches, if care is exercised in locating them in the - chuck.\" a the spindle drive is by a belt from -a self-contained countershaft, which is located on the center of oscillation of the swinging arm. the drive is sup- ported by bearings in the trunnions and also by a bearing on the bed. the work is located on a substantial platen which is provided with five t-slots. a water pump on the countershaft supplies solu- tion for wet grinding. three speeds of oscillation are provided for different lengths of wheel stroke. the machine weighs approximately 8100 pounds and occupies a floor space of 9% x 634 feet, while 20 horsepower is required for operation. ---------- big panama repair the steamship sussex, of the feder- al steam navigation co's. | service, which ran aground in limon bay, pana- ma,' in january, has been repaired. the work of 'drawing the sussex off the breakwater took a week, and. over 1\/00: tons: of 'cargo were removed from her nos. 1 and 2 holds into lighters before the vessel could be pulled off by the tugs gorgona and tavernilla and the salvage steamer favorite of the panama canal service. the sussex was then taken through the canal to-go into drydock in' the 1000- foot dock at balboa. as a preliminary to the drydocking, the bottom of the sussex was examined by a diver, to ascertain the extent of the damage and to see that no damaged portion of the hull would interfere with a proper landing on the keel blocks. the damage itself extended from the forepeak. to about the center of no. 1 hatch, approximately 45 plates have been removed, 36 of which were so badly torn or' dented as to require renewal. a new section of stem from the scarph at the 26-foot line to the keel plate was forged and _ installed. all of the frames in the forepeak have been renewed and two frames in no. 1 hold renewed, the balance straightened and stiffened by the installation of new reverse bars, this describes only in a limited way the work required, as, in connection with this, a number of miscellaneous items must be handled at the same time, such as no. 1 tank top, margin plate, bilge brackets, stringers, breast hooks, collision bulk- head; etc, incident to this work the ship has been under special survey and has had all sea valves overhauled, tail shaft drawn for examination of the stern bearing, rudder lifted, steering gear overhauled, several pumps _ repaired, bilge and ballast lines to the no. 1 tank 'overhauled, deck winches and anchor windlass examined, cables ranged and inspected, rails straightened, and minor repairs in other respects on equipment or fittings which usually be- come more or less strained or damaged as a result of grounding and wrecking operations. the case emphasizes the value of the facilities maintained by the canal
